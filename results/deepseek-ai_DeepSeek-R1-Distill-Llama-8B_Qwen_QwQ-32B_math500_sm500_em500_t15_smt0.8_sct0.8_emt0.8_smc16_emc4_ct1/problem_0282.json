I notice that this is an alternating series where the signs alternate between positive and negative with each consecutive number.\n\nNext, I observe that the series can be grouped into pairs of two consecutive numbers. Each pair takes the form (2k-1) - 2k, where k ranges from 1 to 50. \n\nCalculating each pair, I find that (2k-1) - 2k simplifies to -1. Since there are 50 such pairs, multiplying the result of each pair by 50 gives a total of -50.\n\nFinally, the overall sum of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n---\n\nLet's compute the sum step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Series\nThe given series alternates between subtraction and addition:\n\\[\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n\\]\nThere are 100 terms in total, and the last operation is subtraction since the series ends with \\(99 - 100\\).\n\n### Step 2: Group the Terms\nNotice that the series can be grouped into pairs:\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\nEach pair has the form \\((2k - 1) - 2k\\) for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(50\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute Each Pair\nCompute one pair to find a pattern:\n\\[\n(2k - 1) - 2k = -1\n\\]\nEach pair equals \\(-1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Pairs\nThere are \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\) pairs in total.\n\n### Step 5: Sum All Pairs\nMultiply the result of one pair by the number of pairs:\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
