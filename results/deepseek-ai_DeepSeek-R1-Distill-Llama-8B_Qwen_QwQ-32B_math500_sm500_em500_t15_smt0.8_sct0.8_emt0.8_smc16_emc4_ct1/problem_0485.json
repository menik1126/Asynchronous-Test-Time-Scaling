The cube has a side length of 3 inches, so the volume is calculated by raising the side length to the power of three.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the steel sphere. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the volume formula for a sphere is \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\\).\n\nAfter finding the volume of the sphere, I'll subtract it from the volume of the cube to find out how much metal was removed.\n\nFinally, the volume of the cube, which represents the original amount of metal before any was removed, is the final answer.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nA steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n**Solution:**  \nTo find the volume of the cube that results in a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius after removing metal from its corners, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Sphere:**  \n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]  \n   Given that the radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (27) = 36 \\pi \\ \\text{cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Cube:**  \n   To form a sphere by removing metal from the corners of a cube, the sphere must fit perfectly within the cube. This means the sphere's diameter is equal to the side length of the cube.  \n   The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\ \\text{inches}\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the side length \\( s \\) of the cube is 6 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**  \n   The volume \\( V_{\\text{cube}} \\) of a cube is given by:"
