            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem. We have a cube from which the corners are removed to form a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius. The goal is to find the volume of the original cube.\n\nSince the sphere is formed by cutting off the cube's corners, each corner is a small cube. The volume removed from each corner is a small cube with a side length equal to \\( r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe sphere's radius is 3 inches, so \\( r = 3 \\) inches. This means each corner cube has a side length of 3 inches.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many corners a cube has. A cube has 8 corners.\n\nNow, I can calculate the total volume removed from the cube. Each corner cube has a volume of \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27 \\) cubic inches. Since there are 8 corners, the total volume removed is \\( 8 \\times 27 = 216 \\) cubic inches.\n\nFinally, to find the original cube's volume before any metal was removed, I add the volume of the sphere to the total volume removed. The volume of the sphere is \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\nAdding this to the removed volume: \\( 216 + 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\nSo, the original cube has a volume of \\( 216 + 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   - A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is formed by cutting off the corners of a cube.\n   - Each corner removed is a smaller cube with side length equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (27) = 36\\"
