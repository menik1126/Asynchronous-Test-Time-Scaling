Let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls attending the math club meeting and \\( b \\) represent the number of boys.\n\nNext, I know that the total number of students is 35, so I can write the equation:\n\\[ g + b = 35 \\]\n\nIt's given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. The multiples of 13 up to 35 are 13 and 26. Since there are more girls than boys, 13 is the appropriate choice for the number of girls.\n\nFinally, by substituting \\( g = 13 \\) into the total students equation:\n\\[ 13 + b = 35 \\]\nSolving for \\( b \\) gives:\n\\[ b = 22 \\]\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( g \\) = number of girls\n- \\( b \\) = number of boys\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students as the sum of girls and boys.\n\n\\[\ng + b = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the possible number of girls. Since \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( g > b \\), we find the multiples of 13 less than 35.\n\n- 13 × 1 = 13\n- 13 × 2 = 26\n\nHere, \\( g = 26 \\) because there are more girls than boys.\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute \\( g = 26 \\) into the equation from Step 1 to find \\( b \\).\n\n\\[\n26 + b = 35\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = 35 - 26\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = 9\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
