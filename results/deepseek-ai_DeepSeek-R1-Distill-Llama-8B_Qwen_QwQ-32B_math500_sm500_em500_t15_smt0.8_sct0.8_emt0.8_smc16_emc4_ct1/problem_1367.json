Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls.\n\nNext, from the problem, I know that the total number of students is 35. This gives the equation:\n\\( b + g = 35 \\)\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Therefore, \\( g \\) must be one of the multiples of 13 that is less than 35. The possible values for \\( g \\) are 13 and 26.\n\nAdditionally, there are more girls than boys at the meeting, which means:\n\\( g > b \\)\n\nNow, I'll substitute the possible values of \\( g \\) into the total students equation to find the corresponding number of boys.\n\nFirst, if \\( g = 13 \\):\n\\( b + 13 = 35 \\)\n\\( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\nBut \\( 22 \\) is greater than \\( 13 \\), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nNext, if \\( g = 26 \\):\n\\( b + 26 = 35 \\)\n\\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)\nHere, \\( 9 \\) is less than \\( 26 \\), which satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when there are 9 boys and 26 girls at the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys (\\( g > b \\)).\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( b \\) = Number of boys\n- \\( g \\) = Number of girls\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students in terms of boys and girls.\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13, possible values for \\( g \\) are 13 and 26 (since 39 would exceed the total number of students).\n\n**Step 3:** Test each possible value of \\( g \\) to satisfy \\( g > b \\).\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( g = 13 \\)\n  \\[ b = "
