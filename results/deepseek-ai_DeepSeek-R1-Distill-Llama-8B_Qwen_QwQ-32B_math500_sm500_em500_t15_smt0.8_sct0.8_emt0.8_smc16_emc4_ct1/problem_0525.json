            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\). The goal is to write it in the form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are positive integers. Then, I have to add them up to find \\(A + B + C + D\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that when simplifying expressions with square roots in the denominator, a common method is to rationalize the denominator. That involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). So, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by that.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator first: \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\((\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\\), so \\(4 - 3 = 1\\). That simplifies the denominator to 1, which is nice because it makes the expression easier.\n\nNow, focusing on the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{2} \\times 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n2. \\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\)\n3. \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)\n4. \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nAdding all these together:\n\n\\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nSo,"

Since the denominator is 1, the entire expression becomes \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nNow, I need to express this in the form \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\).\n\nLooking at my current expression: \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\). Hmm, can I factor out a 2 from the first two terms?\n\nYes:\n\n\\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\)\n\nOkay, that looks like it's in the desired form where:\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\) because it's inside the first parentheses\n- The second parentheses are \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}\\), so \\(C = 3\\) and \\(D = 6\\)\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \\(\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D}\\), so yes, that matches.\n\nNow, adding them up: \\(A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\(2 + 2 = 4\\), \\(3 + 6 = 9\\), so \\(4 + 9 = 13\\).\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. I rationalized the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). That's correct.\n2. The denominator simplified to \\(4 - 3 = 1\\), which seems right.\n3. Multiplying out the numerator: \\( (1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) \\) gives \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\). That looks correct.\n4. Factoring out the 2 from the first two terms gives \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\). Yes, that's in the desired form.\n5. Identifying \\(A = 2\\), \\(B ="
