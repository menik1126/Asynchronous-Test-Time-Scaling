            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the value of tan A for triangle ABC, given that its area is equal to a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using several formulas. One common formula is (1/2)*base*height, but another useful one is using the sine of an angle: (1/2)*b*c*sin A, where b and c are two sides, and A is the included angle. So maybe I can use this formula to relate the given area expression to tan A.\n\nGiven that the area is a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, I can write that as:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nI need to express this in terms of sine to relate it to tan A. Let me compute the expression a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2 first. Expanding it, I get:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2\n\nSo, the area is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should try expressing this differently.\n\nAlternatively, I know that in a triangle, by the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A. Maybe I can substitute this into the area expression.\n\nSo substituting a\u00b2 into the area formula:\n\nArea = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A) - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nLet me compute (b - c)\u00b2:\n\n(b - c)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\nArea = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A) - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nb\u00b2 - b\u00b2 cancels out, c\u00b2 - c\u00b2 cancels out, so we have:\n\n-2bc*cos A + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A)\n\nSo, the area is 2bc(1 - cos A). But earlier, the area was given as a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, which"

Wait, from the given area expression, we have:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2 = 2bc(1 - cos A)\n\nBut we also have another expression for the area:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A)\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A)\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see, I can cancel out bc from both sides, assuming bc \u2260 0, which they aren't in a triangle.\n\nSo, (1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nsin A = 4(1 - cos A)\n\nNow, let me express this in terms of tan A. Maybe I can divide both sides by cos A to get tan A involved.\n\nDivide both sides by cos A:\n\n(sin A)/cos A = 4(1 - cos A)/cos A\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ntan A = 4*(1 - cos A)/cos A\n\nHmm, but this still has cos A in the denominator. Maybe I can express this differently. Let me see if I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity 1 - cos A = 2 sin\u00b2(A/2), but I don't know if that will help.\n\nWait, let's go back to the equation:\n\nsin A = 4(1 - cos A)\n\nI can also recall that 1 - cos A = 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) and sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). Let's substitute these into the equation:\n\n2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 4 * 2 sin\u00b2(A/2)\n\nWait, that might be a bit complicated. Let me see:\n\nWait, 1 - cos A is 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). So,\n\nsin A = 4 * (2 sin\u00b2(A/2)) ?\n\nWait, no:\n\nsin A = 4 * (1 - cos A) = 4*(2 sin\u00b2(A/2)) = 8 sin\u00b2(A/2)\n\nBut sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A"

The double-angle formula for tan:\n\ntan A = 2 tan(A/2)/(1 - tan\u00b2(A/2))\n\nSince tan(A/2) is 1/4, let's plug that in:\n\ntan A = 2*(1/4)/(1 - (1/4)^2) = (1/2)/(1 - 1/16) = (1/2)/(15/16) = (1/2)*(16/15) = 8/15\n\nSo, tan A is 8/15.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.\n\nWait, so if tan(A/2) = 1/4, then tan A = 2*(1/4)/(1 - (1/4)^2) = (1/2)/(15/16) = (1/2)*(16/15) = 8/15. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it without using half-angle identities. Let's go back to the equation:\n\nsin A = 4(1 - cos A)\n\nDivide both sides by cos A:\n\ntan A = 4*(1 - cos A)/cos A\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\ntan A = 4*(1/cos A - 1)\n\nHmm, but maybe not as helpful. Alternatively, let me square both sides of sin A = 4(1 - cos A):\n\nsin\u00b2 A = 16(1 - cos A)^2\n\nNow, using the identity sin\u00b2 A = 1 - cos\u00b2 A:\n\n1 - cos\u00b2 A = 16(1 - 2 cos A + cos\u00b2 A)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n1 - cos\u00b2 A = 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos\u00b2 A\n\nBring"

Let's solve for cos A.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\ncos A = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(32\u00b2 - 4*17*15)]/(2*17)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 1024 - 4*17*15 = 1024 - 1020 = 4\n\nSo,\n\ncos A = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(4)]/34 = [32 \u00b1 2]/34\n\nThus, two possibilities:\n\ncos A = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1, or cos A = (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17\n\nBut cos A = 1 would imply angle A is 0, which is impossible in a triangle. So, cos A = 15/17.\n\nThen, since sin A = 4(1 - cos A) from earlier,\n\nsin A = 4*(1 - 15/17) = 4*(2/17) = 8/17\n\nTherefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15.\n\nSo, that confirms that tan A is 8/15.\n\nWait, so two different methods, both leading to the same answer. So that gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 8/15.\n</think>\n\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\).
