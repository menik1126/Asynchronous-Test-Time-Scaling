To do this, I should find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods in seconds.\n\nI'll start by converting the gears' rotational speeds from turns per minute to turns per second. \n\nGear 1 turns 33 1⁄3 times per minute, which is 200⁄6 ≈ 33.333 turns per minute. Converting this to turns per second:\n\n33 1⁄3 turns/minute ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 200⁄6 × 1/60 = 200⁄360 = 5⁄9 turns per second.\n\nGear 2 turns 45 times per minute, so:\n\n45 turns/minute ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 45/60 = 3/4 turns per second.\n\nNext, I'll express these fractional turns as fractions to find their LCM. \n\n5⁄9 and 3⁄4 can be represented as 5/9 and 3/4. To find the LCM of these fractions, I'll convert them to their simplest forms and then find the LCM of the numerators divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators.\n\nFirst, find the LCM of 5 and 3, which is 15. Then, find the GCD of 9 and 4, which is 1. Therefore, the LCM of 5⁄9 and 3⁄4 is 15⁄1 = 15.\n\nThis means the LCM of their periods is 15 seconds. So, after 15 seconds, both gears will align their marks pointing north.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will next align their marks pointing north, we need to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their rotational periods in seconds.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the number of turns per minute to turns per second**\n\n- **Gear 1:** \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) turns per minute\n  \\[\n  33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ turns per minute}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{100}{3} \\div 60 = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ turns per second"

Let me recheck:\n\nAlternatively, since LCM of turns per second fractions might be better approached by LCM of their periods directly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: \n\nThe time when both marks align is the LCM of their periods. \n\nPeriod of Gear 1: \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds per turn.\n\nPeriod of Gear 2: \\( \\frac"
