That means it takes 1 minute to complete a full cycle. So, it returns to north every minute. \n\nThe second gear makes 45 turns in a minute, which means it also completes a full cycle every minute. Therefore, both gears align with north every minute. \n\nTo convert minutes to seconds, I'll multiply 1 minute by 60 seconds. \n\\n\\n\nEventually, both gears will align north after 60 seconds.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's determine after how many seconds both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n\n1. **Determine the Period of Each Gear:**\n   - **First Gear:** Completes \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) turns in one minute.  \n     This means it makes one full rotation (and returns to the north position) every minute.\n   \n   - **Second Gear:** Completes 45 turns in one minute.  \n     This means it makes one full rotation (and returns to the north position) every minute.\n\n2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Their Periods:**\n   - Since both gears return to the north position every minute, the **time until they align again** is the LCM of their periods.\n   \n   - The LCM of 1 minute and 1 minute is **1 minute**.\n\n3. **Convert Minutes to Seconds:**\n   - \\( 1 \\) minute \\( = 60 \\) seconds.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]"
