Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since n \u2261 2 mod 7, that means when I divide n by 7, the remainder is 2. So, n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. Maybe plugging that into the expression will help. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's substitute n = 7k + 2 into each term:\n\n(n + 2) = (7k + 2 + 2) = 7k + 4\n(n + 4) = (7k + 2 + 4) = 7k + 6\n(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 6) = 7k + 8\n\nNow, simplifying each of these modulo 7 might make things easier because when you divide by 7, the terms with 7k will just disappear since 7k is a multiple of 7.\n\nSo, let's compute each term modulo 7:\n\n(n + 2) mod 7 = (7k + 4) mod 7 = 4 mod 7 = 4\n(n + 4) mod 7 = (7k + 6) mod 7 = 6 mod 7 = 6\n(n + 6) mod 7 = (7k + 8) mod 7. Wait, 8 mod 7 is 1, right? So that becomes 1 mod 7 = 1.\n\nSo now, instead of dealing with those complicated terms, I have (4)(6)(1) mod 7. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nThen, 24 * 1 = 24.\n\nNow, I need to find 24 mod 7. Let me divide 24 by 7 to see what the remainder is. 7 goes into 24 three times, which is 21, and 24 - 21 = 3. So, 24 mod 7 = 3.\n\nWait, does that mean the remainder is"

Let me just double-check my steps to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, starting with n \u2261 2 mod 7, then n + 2 is 4 mod 7, n + 4 is 6 mod 7, and n + 6 is 1 mod 7. Multiplying those gives 4*6*1 = 24, and 24 mod 7 is indeed 3. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach I can use to verify. Sometimes, when dealing with modular arithmetic, it's helpful to use properties like Fermat's little theorem or to expand the expression before substituting.\n\nLet me try expanding (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) first. Maybe that will give me some insight.\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply (n + 2)(n + 4):\n\n(n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8\n\nNow, multiply that by (n + 6):\n\n(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n + 6n^2 + 36n + 48\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) = n^3 + 12n^2\n8n + 36n = 44n\nAnd the constant term is 48.\n\nSo, the expanded form is n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48.\n\nNow, I need to compute this modulo 7. Since n \u2261 2 mod 7, I can substitute n = 2 into the polynomial and then take mod 7.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nn^3 = 2^3 = 8\n12n^2 = 12*(2)^2 = 12*4 = 48\n44n = 44*2 = 88\n48 is just 48\n\nAdding them all up: 8 + 48 + 88 + 48 = let's see:\n\n8 + 48 = 56\n56 + 88 = 144\n144 + 48 ="

So again, I get a remainder of 3.\n\nWait, so both methods gave me the same result, which is 3. That makes me more confident that my answer is correct.\n\nAnother thought: since we're dealing with modulo 7, maybe we can use the fact that (a)(b)(c) mod 7 is equivalent to (a mod 7)(b mod 7)(c mod 7) mod 7. Which is exactly what I did in the first approach. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using the fact that in mod 7, adding 7 doesn't change the value, so each term can be reduced mod 7 first before multiplying.\n\nSo, (n + 2) mod 7 = 4, (n + 4) mod 7 = 6, and (n + 6) mod 7 = 1. So, 4*6 is 24, which mod 7 is 3, and then 3*1 is 3, so that's consistent with earlier steps.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly. So, the remainder is 3 when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7, given that n \u2261 2 mod 7.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we can express \\( n \\) as \\( n = 7k + 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n1.
