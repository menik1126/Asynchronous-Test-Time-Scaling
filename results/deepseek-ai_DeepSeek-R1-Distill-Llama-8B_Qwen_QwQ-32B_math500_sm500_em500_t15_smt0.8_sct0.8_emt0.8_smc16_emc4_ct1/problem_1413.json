Given that the radius of the tank is 6 cm, the volume is (4/3)π(6)³ = 288π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. With a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, the volume is π(3)²(8) = 72π cm³.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed, I'll divide the total volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker: 288π / 72π = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank.**\n\n   The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   Where \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the spherical tank, \\( r = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plugging in the value:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (216) = 288 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker.**\n\n   The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - Radius of the cylinder, \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - Height of the cylinder, \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8)"
