            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. Given that the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, plugging these values into the formula gives me \\( V = \\pi \\times 3^2 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\). The radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm, so substituting this into the formula results in \\( V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 6^3 = 144\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I will divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylinder. That is, \\( \\frac{144\\pi}{72\\pi} = 2 \\). Therefore, it will take 2 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   - **Radius of the beaker** (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   - **Height of the beaker** (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 8 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\,\\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   - **Radius of the tank** (\\( R \\)) = 6 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n"
