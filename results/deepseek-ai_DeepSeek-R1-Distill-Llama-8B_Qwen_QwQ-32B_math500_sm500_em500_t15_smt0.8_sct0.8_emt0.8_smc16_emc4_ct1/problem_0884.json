I find that both numbers are divisible by 19.\n\nNext, I will divide the numerator and the denominator by 19 to simplify the fraction. This gives me 3/ (160/19) = 3/8.4.\n\nThen, I will convert the simplified fraction 3/8.4 into a decimal by performing the division 3 \u00f7 8.4, which equals approximately 0.357142857.\n\nFinally, I recognize that the decimal repeats indefinitely, so the terminating decimal representation of 57/160 is approximately 0.3571 with a bar over the repeating part indicating the ongoing repetition.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   \n   First, check if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. Both 57 and 160 are divisible by 19.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\div 19}{160 \\div 19} = \\frac{3}{8.4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   \n   Here, the denominator is already in a decimal format. To convert \\(\\frac{3}{8.4}\\) to a decimal:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8.4} \\approx 0.3571428...\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Part:**\n   \n   The decimal repeats indefinitely as \\(0.3571428571428...\\). The repeating sequence is \"571428\".\n\n4. **Express the Terminating Decimal:**\n   \n   Since the decimal does not terminate naturally, we can express it as approximately \\(0.3571\\) with a bar over the repeating part.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.3571428571428...}\n\\]"
