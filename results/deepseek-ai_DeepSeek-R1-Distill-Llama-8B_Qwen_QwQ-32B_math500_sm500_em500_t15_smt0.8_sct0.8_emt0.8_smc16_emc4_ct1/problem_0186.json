I need to find the magnitude of w, which is |w|. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the magnitude (or modulus) of a complex number a + bi is calculated as sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, I can then compute its modulus. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut using properties of complex numbers that could make this easier without having to fully separate w into real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\nz = 1 + i\n\nw = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7)\n\nHmm, so I can substitute z into this expression. Let me compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 first.\n\nCalculating 3z + 1:\n\n3z = 3*(1 + i) = 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i\n\nSo, 3z + 1 = (3 + 3i) + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\nSimilarly, calculating 5z + 7:\n\n5z = 5*(1 + i) = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i\n\nSo, 5z + 7 = (5 + 5i) + 7 = 12 + 5i\n\nTherefore, w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i)\n\nNow, to find |w|, the modulus of w, I can use the property that for any two complex numbers a and b, |a/b| = |a| / |b|. That is, the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli.\n\nSo, |w| = |(4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i)| = |4 + 3i| / |12 + 5i|\n\nAlright, so I can compute |4 + 3i| and |12 + 5i| separately.\n\nCalculating |4 + 3i|:\n\nThe modulus is sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(16 +"

So, is the answer just 5/13? Hmm, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nFirst, checking 3z + 1:\n\nz = 1 + i, so 3z = 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i\n\n3z + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i, which is correct.\n\nThen, 5z + 7:\n\n5z = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i\n\n5z + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i, which also looks correct.\n\nCalculating the moduli:\n\nFor numerator: sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = 5\n\nDenominator: sqrt(12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = 13\n\nSo, |w| = 5/13. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to solve it by expressing w as a + bi, I could do that as well, just to confirm.\n\nSo, let's try that method too.\n\nStarting with w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i)\n\nTo express this as a + bi, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo,\n\nw = (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nLet's compute the denominator first:\n\n(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 - 25i\u00b2 = 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169\n\nSo, denominator is 169.\n\nNow, numerator:\n\n(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) = 4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i)\n\nCalculating each term"

Since i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nImaginary parts: (-20i + 36i) = 16i\n\nSo, numerator becomes 63 + 16i\n\nTherefore, w = (63 + 16i)/169\n\nSo, w = (63/169) + (16/169)i\n\nNow, compute |w|:\n\n|w| = sqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 )\n\nBut wait, that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, since |w| = |63 +16i| / |169|. Wait, no, 169 is the denominator.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Since w is (63 +16i)/169, which is (63 +16i) multiplied by 1/169. So, the magnitude would be (|63 +16i|) * |1/169|.\n\nSince |1/169| = 1/169, then |w| = (sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)) * (1/169)\n\nCompute sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2):\n\n63\u00b2 = 3969\n\n16\u00b2 = 256\n\n3969 + 256 = 4225\n\nsqrt(4225) = 65\n\nSo, |w| = 65 * (1/169) = 65/169\n\nWait, that's the same as 5/13, because 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. So, 65/169 reduces to 5/13.\n\nOh, that's consistent with the earlier method. So, the answer is indeed 5/13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is 5/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe magnitude of \\( w \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( z = 1 + i \\) and \\( w = \\dfrac{3z + 1}{5z + "
