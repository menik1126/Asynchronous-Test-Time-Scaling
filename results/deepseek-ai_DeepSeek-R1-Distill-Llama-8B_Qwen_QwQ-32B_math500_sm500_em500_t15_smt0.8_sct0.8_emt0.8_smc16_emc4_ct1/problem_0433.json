This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\nNext, I find the total number of terms in the sequence. Since the common difference is 2, the number of terms \\(n\\) can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\nSolving for \\(n\\), I get:\n\\[\nn = 100\n\\]\nNow, I calculate the sum of the first 100 terms of this arithmetic sequence using the formula:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nS_{100} = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000\n\\]\nFinally, I find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives 1 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, the remainder of the sum when divided by 7 is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n1. **Identify the Series:**\n   - The given series is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\), and the last term (\\(a_n\\)) is \\(199\\).\n   - Using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n     Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - "
