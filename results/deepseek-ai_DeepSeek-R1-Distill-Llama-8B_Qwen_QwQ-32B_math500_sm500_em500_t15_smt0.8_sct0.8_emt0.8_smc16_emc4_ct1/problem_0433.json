The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\na\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n\nGiven that the last term a\u2099 is 199 and the common difference d is 2, I can solve for n:\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \u00d7 2\n198 = (n - 1) \u00d7 2\n99 = n - 1\nn = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in the sequence.\n\nNext, I calculate the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence using the formula:\nS\u2099 = (n/2) \u00d7 (a\u2081 + a\u2099)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\nS\u2081\u2080\u2080 = (100/2) \u00d7 (1 + 199)\nS\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 50 \u00d7 200\nS\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 10,000\n\nFinally, I find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7 by performing integer division:\n10,000 \u00f7 7 = 1,428 with a remainder of 4\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by \\(7\\), follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Number of Terms in the Sequence**\n\nThe given sequence is an **arithmetic sequence** where:\n- **First term (a\u2081)** = 1\n- **Common difference (d)** = 2\n\nThe **n**th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nWe know the last term \\(a_n = 199\\).
