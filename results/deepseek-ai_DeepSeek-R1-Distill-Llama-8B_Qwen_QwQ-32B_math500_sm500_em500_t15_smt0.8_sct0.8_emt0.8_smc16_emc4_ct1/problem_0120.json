I'm given a binary number, 10101001110, and I need to find its equivalent in base eight.\n\nTo convert from binary to base eight, I should group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Each set of three binary digits will be converted into a single octal digit.\n\nLet me write down the binary number: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0.\n\nNext, I'll separate the binary digits into groups of three, starting from the right. This will help in identifying each octal digit accurately.\n\nStarting from the right, the first three digits are 1 1 0. Then, moving left, the next three digits are 1 0 0. The remaining digits are 1 0 1 0.\n\nNow, I'll convert each group of three binary digits into their respective octal values.\n\nFor the first group (1 1 0), the binary value is 6, which corresponds to the octal digit 6.\n\nFor the second group (1 0 0), the binary value is 4, which corresponds to the octal digit 4.\n\nFor the remaining digits (1 0 1 0), I'll need to group them again. The first two digits (1 0) won't form a complete group of three, so I'll add a leading zero to make it (0 1 0 1 0). Now, grouping them as (0 1 0) and (1 0), the binary values are 2 and 2, corresponding to the octal digits 2 and 2.\n\nCombining all these octal digits, the binary number 10101001110 in base eight is equal to 242620.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right:**\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   *(Note: Add a leading zero to make the last group a complete set of three digits.)*\n\n2. **Convert each binary triplet to its corresponding octal value:**\n   - \\(101_2 = 5_8\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_8\\)\n   -"
