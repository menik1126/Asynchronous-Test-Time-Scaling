            "output": "First, I need to convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight. To do this, I'll divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right.\n\nThe binary number is 10101001110. Let's separate it into groups of three:\n10 101 011 10\n\nNext, I'll convert each group of three bits into a corresponding decimal value. Each group represents a hexadecimal digit.\n\n- 10 corresponds to 2 in decimal.\n- 101 corresponds to 5 in decimal.\n- 011 corresponds to 3 in decimal.\n- 10 corresponds to 2 in decimal.\n\nNow, I'll combine these decimal values to form the hexadecimal number. The groups, in order, are 2, 5, 3, and 2. Therefore, the binary number 10101001110 is equal to 2532 in base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right.**\n\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert each group of three bits into their corresponding hexadecimal values.**\n\n   - \\(101_2 = 5_{10}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_{10}\\)\n   - \\(011_2 = 3_{10}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = 2_{10}\\)\n\n3. **Write the hexadecimal number by combining the converted values.**\n\n   ```\n   2\\, 5\\, 3\\, 2\n   ```\n\n   So, the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) is equal to \\(2532_8\\).\n\n\\boxed{2532_8}"
