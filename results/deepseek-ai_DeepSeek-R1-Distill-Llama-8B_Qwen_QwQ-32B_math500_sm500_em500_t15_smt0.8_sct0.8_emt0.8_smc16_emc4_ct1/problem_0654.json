The problem says that P(x) is squeezed between two other quadratic functions: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. And it also tells me that P(11) is 181. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it should have the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. My goal is to find the coefficients a, b, and c, and then use them to compute P(16).\n\nThe problem states that for all real numbers x, the polynomial satisfies the inequality:\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nSo, P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics everywhere. That probably means that P(x) touches one of these bounds at certain points but doesn't go below the lower one or above the upper one. Since both of these bounds are quadratics, maybe P(x) is some kind of average or combination of them? Or perhaps P(x) coincides with one of them at certain intervals?\n\nWait, but since both are quadratics, their difference will be zero at some points. Let me think. Maybe the polynomials x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3 are touching P(x) at specific points or maybe they intersect at a single point, making P(x) equal to both at that point. That could mean there's a unique point where both are equal, and P(x) lies between them otherwise.\n\nLet me try setting the two bounds equal to each other to find where they intersect:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 = 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 = 2x² - 4x + 3  \n0 = x² - 2x + 1.\n\nThat factors as (x - 1)² = 0, so the only solution is x = 1.\n\nSo, at x = 1, both bounds are equal to P(1) because P(x) is squeezed between them"

That gives me one equation: P(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c = 1.\n\nAlso, we know that P(11) = 181. So that gives another equation: a(11)^2 + b(11) + c = 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 1\n\n2) 121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nBut I need a third equation to solve for the three variables a, b, c. Since the polynomial P(x) is between the two quadratics for all real x, maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is non-negative, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is also non-negative. So, perhaps P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 and (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x. \n\nLet me denote the lower difference as D1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a -1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2).\n\nSimilarly, the upper difference is D2(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c).\n\nSince both D1(x) and D2(x) must be non-negative for all real x, they must be quadratic polynomials that are always non-negative. For a quadratic to be non-negative for all real x, it must open upwards (coefficient of x² is non-negative) and have a discriminant ≤ 0. Similarly, if it"

D1 is the difference between P(x) and the lower bound, which is itself a quadratic. But for D1 ≤0, it can't be negative, so D1 must be a non-positive quadratic. That can only happen if D1 is a concave down parabola (coefficient of x² negative) and its maximum is ≤0.\n\nBut earlier, when analyzing D1, I concluded that since it's P(x) ≥ lower bound, D1 is non-negative, so the quadratic D1 must be non-negative for all x, which requires it to open upwards (positive coefficient) and have a discriminant ≤0.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting.

So when I substituted, I was trying to express it in terms of a, so I expressed D1 in terms of a, but perhaps that's not the right way because D1 is a function of x, so its discriminant as a quadratic in x, which we can write in terms of a.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the discriminant of D1 as a function of x, which is the discriminant I wrote earlier, which is 100a² -360a +324.\n\nWait, but that was from when I expanded D1 in terms of a. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let me consider D1(x) as a function in x, so:\n\nD1(x) = (a -1)x² + (b +2)x +"
