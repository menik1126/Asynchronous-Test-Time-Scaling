            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Find k if (3^k)^6 equals 3^6. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you can multiply them. So, (3^k)^6 should be 3^(k*6), right? That simplifies to 3^(6k). \n\nNow, the equation is 3^(6k) equals 3^6. I remember that if two exponents with the same base are equal, then their exponents must be equal too. So that means 6k should equal 6. If I set 6k = 6, then I can solve for k by dividing both sides by 6. That gives k = 1. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If k is 1, then (3^1)^6 is 3^6, which is indeed equal to 3^6. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), we can use the properties of exponents.\n\n1. Apply the power of a power property: \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\).\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n2. Set the exponents equal since the bases are the same:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n3. Solve for \\(k\\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   k = 1\n   \\]\n\nThe value of \\(k\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."
