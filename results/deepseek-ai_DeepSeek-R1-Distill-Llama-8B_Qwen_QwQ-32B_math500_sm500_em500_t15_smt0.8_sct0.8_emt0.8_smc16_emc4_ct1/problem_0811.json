The polynomial is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nIt has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. We know that \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\). The question is asking for the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, that means it can be factored into linear terms with integer roots. Because all the coefficients are integers, the roots have to be integers as well.\n\nLet me recall Vieta's formulas because they relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a polynomial of degree \\( n \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -a_{n-1}/a_n \\), and the product of the roots is \\( (-1)^n a_0/a_n \\).\n\nGiven that \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\), the product of the roots is \\( (-1)^n \\times 66/2 = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\). So, the roots multiply to \\( 33 \\) or \\( -33 \\) depending on whether the degree is even or odd.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Let me write that down properly. Vieta's formula for the product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\) is \\( (-1)^n a_0 / a_n \\). So here, it's \\( (-1)^n \\times 66 / 2 = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\). So the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nBut 33 factors into prime factors as \\( 3 \\times 11 \\). So the roots are integers, distinct, and their product is either 33 or -33. So we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and from that, construct the polynomial, then find the minimal possible \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) where \\( a_{n-1} \\) is the negative of the sum of the"

Specifically, \\( a_{n-1} = -2S \\), where \\( S \\) is the sum of the roots. So, \\( |a_{n-1}| = | -2S | = 2|S| \\). Therefore, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), we need to minimize \\( |S| \\), the absolute value of the sum of the roots.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, such that their sum \\( S \\) has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nLet me note that since the roots are distinct integers, we need to consider all possible factorizations of 33 (and -33) into distinct integers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 33.\n\n33 factors into 1, 3, 11, 33. Similarly, -33 factors into -1, -3, -11, -33.\n\nSo the possible sets of roots are subsets of these factors that multiply to 33 or -33.\n\nGiven that roots must be distinct, we can't have repeated factors.\n\nSo let's list all possible sets of integers (positive or negative) whose product is 33 or -33, with all integers distinct.\n\nLet me think about this. The simplest cases would be single roots or pairs, triplets, etc.\n\nBut since we're looking for minimal |S|, we should consider the smallest number of roots because adding more roots might complicate the sum. But it's not necessarily the case, because sometimes adding more roots can result in a smaller sum.\n\nWait, for example, having more roots could result in cancellation in the sum, leading to a smaller total sum. So perhaps even if we have more roots, the sum could be smaller in absolute value.\n\nBut since we have to multiply to 33 or -33, it's more constrained.\n\nLet me list all possible sets of factors for 33 and -33.\n\nStarting with positive 33:\n\nPossible factorizations with distinct integers:\n\n1) 1, 3, 11, 33 (product 1*3*11*33= 33*3=99?

Hmm, but since the product can be either 33 or -33, depending on the degree's parity, but maybe I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that the roots are distinct integers, so they can be positive or negative. So the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, so depending on the degree. But since the problem doesn't specify the degree, perhaps the degree can be chosen as needed? Wait, but the degree is determined by the number of roots. Since all roots are distinct integers, the degree n is equal to the number of roots. So the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, so depending on whether n is even or odd. Wait, but actually, the product is (-1)^n * (a0/a_n).
