            "output": "To determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, I'll start by considering the table's rotational symmetry. Since rotating the table doesn't create a new configuration, I need to account for these symmetries to avoid overcounting.\n\nFirst, I'll fix one person's position to eliminate rotational duplicates. By doing so, I can simplify the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table.\n\nWith one person fixed, the others can be arranged in a circular permutation. For a circular arrangement of \\( n \\) people, the formula is \\((n-1)!\\). Applying this, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\( 7! \\) ways.\n\nHowever, since the table has four sides, and each side must have exactly 2 people, I also need to consider the arrangement of people across the sides. This adds another layer of complexity because the order of people on each side affects the overall configuration.\n\nTo address this, I'll consider dividing the 8 people into groups of 2. The number of ways to partition 8 people into 4 groups of 2 is given by the double factorial formula: \\( \\frac{8!}{(2!)^4 \\cdot 4!} \\). This accounts for grouping and the order of the groups themselves.\n\nFinally, I'll combine the two main considerations: the circular permutation of the remaining 7 people and the grouping of people into pairs. Multiplying these together will give the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to account for the rotational symmetry of the table and the specific seating arrangement required.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   Since rotations of the table are considered equivalent, we can fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational duplicates. This simplifies the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People:**\n   With one person fixed, the remaining 7 can be arranged in a circular permutation. For a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) people is \\( (n-1)! \\). Therefore, there are \\( 7! \\) ways to arrange the remaining people.\n\n3. **Divide the 8"

            "output": " People into Pairs:**\n   The table has 4 sides, each requiring exactly 2 people. We need to partition the 8 people into 4 pairs. The number of ways to partition \\( 2n \\) people into \\( n \\) pairs is given by \\( \\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!} \\). Here, \\( n = 4 \\), so the number of ways is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8!}{2^4 \\cdot 4!}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Arrangements:**\n   Each partition into pairs must be arranged around the table. Since the table is square, the order of the pairs around the table matters, but rotations are already accounted for by fixing one person. However, the pairs themselves can be rotated in a way that doesn’t change the configuration. Thus, we multiply the number of circular permutations by the number of ways to partition into pairs:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8!}{2^4 \\cdot 4!} \\times 7!\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   Notice that \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7! \\), so substituting this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8 \\times 7!}{2^4 \\cdot 4!} \\times 7! = \\frac{8 \\times (7!)^2}{2^4 \\cdot 4!}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2^4 \\cdot 4!} \\times (7!)^2 = \\frac{8}{16 \\cdot 24} \\times (7!)^2 = \\frac{1}{48} \\times (7!)^2\n   \\]\n   However, this approach overcomplicates the problem. A simpler way is to recognize that fixing one person and arranging the rest in pairs around the table directly gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7!}{2^4}\n   \\]\n   Here, after fixing one person, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\( 7! \\) ways, but each side's pair can be swapped (since the order on each side doesn't matter), leading to division by \\( 2^4 \\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   The correct formula is"
