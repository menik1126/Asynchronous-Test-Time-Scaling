Since the table is square, there are 4 sides, and each side has 2 seats. This gives a total of 8 seats. The number of ways to arrange 8 people in 8 seats is 8 factorial (8!).\n\nNext, I'll account for rotational symmetry. Rotating the entire group of people around the table doesn't create a new unique arrangement. Therefore, I need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of positions the table can be rotated without changing the arrangement. Since the table is square, it can be rotated in 4 different ways (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°).\n\nAfter dividing by the number of rotational positions, I'll consider whether any arrangements are identical due to reflections. However, the problem doesn't mention reflections as equivalent, so reflections will be treated as distinct arrangements.\n\nFinally, I'll apply these considerations to find the number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to account for rotational symmetry but not reflections. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements Without Symmetry:**\n   \n   - There are 8 seats around the square table (4 sides × 2 seats each).\n   - The number of ways to arrange 8 people in 8 seats is \\(8!\\) (8 factorial).\n\n   \\[\n   8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320\n   \\]\n\n2. **Accounting for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   \n   - The square table can be rotated in 4 distinct ways (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) without changing the arrangement.\n   - To eliminate overcounting due to these rotations, divide the total arrangements by 4.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8!}{4} = \\frac{40320}{4} = 10080\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Calculation:**\n\n"
