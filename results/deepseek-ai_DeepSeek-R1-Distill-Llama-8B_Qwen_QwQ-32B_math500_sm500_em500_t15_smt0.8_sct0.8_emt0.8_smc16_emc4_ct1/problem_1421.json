Given that the radius of the beaker is 3 cm and its height is 8 cm, I can calculate the volume by plugging in these values.\n\nNext, I should find the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3. The radius of the tank is 6 cm, so I'll use this in the formula to compute its volume.\n\nAfter calculating both volumes, I will divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to determine how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n3. **Determine the number of beakers required to fill the tank.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the cylindrical beaker)\n- \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (height of the cylindrical beaker)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 9 \\times \\pi \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the spherical tank)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\"
