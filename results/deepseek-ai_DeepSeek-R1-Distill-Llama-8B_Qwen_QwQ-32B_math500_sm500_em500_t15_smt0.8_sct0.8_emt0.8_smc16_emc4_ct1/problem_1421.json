            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius of the beaker is 3 cm and its height is 8 cm, I can calculate its volume as V_beaker = π * (3 cm)² * 8 cm.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The tank has a radius of 6 cm, so its volume will be V_tank = (4/3)π * (6 cm)³.\n\nAfter finding both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker to determine how many beakers are needed to fill the tank. This will give me the number of beakers required, which is the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V_cyl \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{cyl} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder (3 cm)\n   - \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder (8 cm)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{cyl} = \\pi (3 \\, \\text{cm})^2 (8 \\, \\text{cm}) = 9\\pi \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{sphere} \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere (6 cm)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6 \\, \\text{cm})^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 216 \\, \\text{cm}^3"
