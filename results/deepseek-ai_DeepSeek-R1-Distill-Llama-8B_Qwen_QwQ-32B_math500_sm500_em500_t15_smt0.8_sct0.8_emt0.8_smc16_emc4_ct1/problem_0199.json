Well, I remember that for finding integer roots, the Rational Root Theorem is really useful. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, according to the theorem, the possible integer roots are just the factors of -14. That would be \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Okay, that's a manageable number of candidates to test. \n\nI guess the next step is to plug each of these possible roots into the equation and see if they satisfy it, meaning the result is zero. Let me start with x=1. Plugging that in: 1\u2074 + 5*1\u00b3 + 9*1\u00b2 - 1 -14. Let's compute that step by step. \n\n1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14. So 1+5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, wow, x=1 is a root! That was easy. So, (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. That means we can factor the polynomial by dividing it by (x - 1). But maybe before factoring, I can also check the other possible roots to see if any of them are also roots.\n\nLet me try x=-1. Plugging in -1: (-1)\u2074 +5*(-1)\u00b3 +9*(-1)\u00b2 - (-1) -14. Calculating each term: 1 (from (-1)^4), 5*(-1)^3 is -5, 9*(-1)^2 is 9, then -(-1) is +1, and -14. So 1 -5 +9 +1 -14. Let's compute that: 1-5 is -4, -4+9 is 5, 5+1 is 6, 6-14 is -8. Not zero, so x=-1 isn't a root. \n\n"

Then subtract 2 and 14: 92-2 is 90, 90-14 is 76. Definitely not zero. So x=2 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=-2? Let's see: (-2)^4 is 16, 5*(-2)^3 is 5*(-8) which is -40, 9*(-2)^2 is 9*4=36, -(-2) is +2, and then -14. So adding them up: 16 -40 is -24, -24+36 is 12, 12+2 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Wait, that's zero! So x=-2 is also a root. Cool, so (x + 2) is another factor.\n\nAlright, so now I have two factors: (x - 1) and (x + 2). Let's see if I can factor the polynomial further. Maybe I should perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Let's try synthetic division with the root x=1 first.\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n1 | 1  5  9  -1  -14\nBring down the 1.\nMultiply 1 by 1 is 1, add to next coefficient: 5+1=6.\nMultiply 6 by 1 is 6, add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.\nMultiply 15 by 1 is 15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\nMultiply 14 by 1 is 14, add to last term: -14 +14=0. So, the remainder is zero, which we knew, and the quotient polynomial is x\u00b3 + 6x\u00b2 +15x +14.\n\nSo now we have (x - 1)(x\u00b3 + 6x\u00b2 +15x +14) = 0. Next, let's try factoring the cubic polynomial. Maybe x=-2 is a root here because we found x=-2 is a root earlier. Let me use synthetic division again"

So, the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x\u00b2 +4x +7). Therefore, the entire polynomial factors as (x - 1)(x + 2)(x\u00b2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, the quadratic factor is x\u00b2 +4x +7. To see if it has integer roots, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = 16 - 28 = -12. Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer roots. So, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that I didn't miss any other possible integer roots. Our initial possible candidates were \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. I tested x=1, x=-1, x=2, x=-2, which gave me two roots. What about x=7 and x=-7? Let me try x=7 just in case I made a mistake or missed something.\n\nPlugging x=7: 7\u2074 +5*7\u00b3 +9*7\u00b2 -7 -14. Let's compute each term:\n\n7\u2074 = 49\u00b2 = 2401\n5*7\u00b3 =5*343=1715\n9*7\u00b2=9*49=441\nSo adding those: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, 4116 +441=4557\nThen subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -7=4550, 4550-14=4536. That's way bigger than zero.\n\nWhat about x=-7? Let's compute:\n\n(-7)^4 = 2401\n5*(-7)^3=5*(-343)=-1715\n9*(-7)^2=9*49=441\n-(-7)=7\n-14\n\nSo 2401 -1715 is 686, 686"

That seems too large, but let's try:\n\n14\u2074 is 14*14*14*14. 14\u00b2 is 196, 14\u00b3 is 196*14=2744, 14\u2074=2744*14=38416\n5*14\u00b3=5*2744=13720\n9*14\u00b2=9*196=1764\n-14\nSo total: 38416 +13720=52136, 52136 +1764=538,100? Wait, 52136+1764=538, no, 52136+1764=538, no, 52136 +1764=538, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 52136 +1764 is actually 538, wait, no, 52136 +1764 is 538, no, that can't be. Wait, let me do it more carefully.\n\n38416 +13720: 38416 +13000=51416, then +720=52136.\n\nThen 52136 +1764: 52136 + 1000=53136, 53136 +700=53836, 53836 +64=53800+64=53840? Wait, 1764 is 1000 + 700 +64. So adding that, 52136 +1000=53136, +700=53836, +64=53900. Then subtract 14: 53900 -14=53886. Definitely not zero.\n\nSimilarly, x=-14 seems way too big, but let's check:\n\n(-14)^4 is still 14\u2074=38416\n5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)=-13720\n9*(-14)^2=9*196=1764\n-(-14)=14\n-14\n\nSo total: 38416 -13720 = 247, 247, let me calculate 38416 -13720: 38416 -13000=25416, 25416 -720=247, 247, wait, that's not right. Wait, 38416 -13720:\n\n38416 - 10000=28416\n28416 - 3000=25416\n25416"

Not zero.\n\nSo x=7 and x=-7, x=14, x=-14 are not roots. Therefore, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, should I maybe try some other values? Maybe I missed something. Hmm, no, the possible integer roots are only the factors of the constant term over the leading coefficient, which in this case is just \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. So I think I've covered all of them.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that maybe trying to factor the quartic directly could yield more factors, but since synthetic division already gave me a quadratic without real roots, I think that's it.\n\nJust to recap, I used the Rational Root Theorem to list out possible integer roots, tested each one by plugging into the equation. Found that x=1 and x=-2 are roots, then performed synthetic division to factor out these roots and found the remaining quadratic has no real roots. Therefore, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the equation are found by testing possible candidates using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Testing these, we find that x=1 and x=-2 satisfy the equation. Using synthetic division, we factor the polynomial into (x - 1)(x + 2)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 7), where the quadratic factor has no real roots. Thus, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nThe integer roots are \\boxed{1}, \\boxed{-2}."
