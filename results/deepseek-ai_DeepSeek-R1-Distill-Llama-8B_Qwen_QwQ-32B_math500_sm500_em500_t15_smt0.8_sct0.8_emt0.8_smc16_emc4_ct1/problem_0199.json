            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). The problem is asking for all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on polynomial root finding, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. Maybe that can help here. The theorem states that any possible rational root of the polynomial equation \\(a_nx^n + \\dots + a_1x + a_0 = 0\\) is of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term \\(a_0\\) and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient \\(a_n\\). Since we're looking for integer roots, we can limit ourselves to the case where \\(q\\) is 1 or -1, meaning the possible roots are just the factors of the constant term.\n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term \\(a_0\\) is -14, and the leading coefficient \\(a_n\\) is 1. So, the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list those out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negatives: -1, -2, -7, -14.\n\nAlright, so the possible integer roots are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. That gives me a manageable list of candidates to test. Now, I need to plug each of these into the polynomial and see if the result is zero.\n\nLet me start with x = 1.\n\nCalculating \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). That simplifies to 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14. Let me add these up: 1+5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, so x=1 is a root! Nice, that's one.\n\nNow, let's try x = -1.\n\nPlugging in, we get \\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\). Calculating each term: (-1"

Not zero, so x=-1 isn't a root.\n\nNext, let's test x=2.\n\nCalculating \\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 -2 -14\\). Breaking it down: 16 (from 2^4) + 5*8 (which is 40) + 9*4 (which is 36) -2 -14. Adding up: 16 + 40 is 56, 56 +36 is 92, 92 -2 is 90, 90 -14 is 76. That's not zero, so x=2 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=-2?\n\nPlugging in: \\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\). Calculating each term: (-2)^4 is 16, 5*(-2)^3 is 5*(-8)= -40, 9*(-2)^2 is 9*4=36, -(-2) is +2, and then -14. So adding up: 16 -40 is -24, -24 +36 is 12, 12 +2 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. Oh, x=-2 is another root! Great.\n\nMoving on, let's test x=7. That might be a bit large, but let's see.\n\nCalculating \\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\). Let's compute each term: 7^4 is 2401, 5*343 (since 7^3 is 343) is 1715, 9*49 is 441. So adding up: 2401 + 1715 is 4116, 4116 +441 is 4557, 4557 -7 is 4550, 4550 -14 is 4536. Definitely not zero. So x=7 isn't a root.\n\nHow"

Now adding them up: 2401 -1715 is 686, 686 +441 is 1127, 1127 +7 is 1134, 1134 -14 is 1120. Not zero, so x=-7 isn't a root.\n\nNext, let's test x=14. I'm expecting this to be a big number, but let's do it.\n\nCalculating \\(14^4 +5(14)^3 +9(14)^2 -14 -14\\). Compute each term: 14^4 is 14*14*14*14. Let's see, 14^2 is 196, 14^3 is 196*14=2744, and 14^4 is 2744*14=38416. Then 5*2744 is 13720, 9*196 is 1764.

So perhaps only x=1 and x=-2 are the integer roots.\n\nBut wait, to be thorough, maybe I should also check if the polynomial can be factored using these roots and see if there are other integer roots.\n\nSince x=1 and x=-2 are roots, I can perform polynomial division to factor them out and see what's left.\n\nLet me try dividing the polynomial by (x - 1) first.\n\nUsing synthetic division for x=1:\n\nThe coefficients are 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nSet up the synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1 \u00a0\u00a05 \u00a0\u00a09 \u00a0\u00a0-1 \u00a0\u00a0-14\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1.
