            "output": "First, I will calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Substituting the given values, the volume of the beaker is π × 3² × 8, which equals 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³. The radius of the tank is 6 cm, so the volume is (4/3)π × 6³, resulting in 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the beaker. So, 288π divided by 72π equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nA cylindrical beaker is 8 cm high and has a radius of 3 cm. How many such beakers of water will it take to fill a spherical tank of radius 6 cm?\n\n**Solution:**  \n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker.**  \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]  \n   Where:  \n   - \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the beaker)  \n   - \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (height of the beaker)  \n\n   Plugging in the values:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**  \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:  \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]  \n   Where:  \n   - \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the tank"
