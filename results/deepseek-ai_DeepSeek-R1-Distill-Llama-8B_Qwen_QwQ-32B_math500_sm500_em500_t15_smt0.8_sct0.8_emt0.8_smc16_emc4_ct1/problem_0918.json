To reach the total product of 84, I need to multiply by 3. So, the set would be {28, 3}, giving a product of 28 * 3 = 84 and a sum of 28 + 3 = 31.\n\nNow, I'll check if there's a better combination without using 28. Removing 28, the next largest is 21.\n\nWith 21, I consider multiplying it by 4: 21 * 4 = 84. The sum is 21 + 4 = 25, which is lower than 31.\n\nContinuing, I'll try 14 next. Multiplying 14 by 6 gives 84. The sum is 14 + 6 = 20, which is even lower.\n\nTrying 12 instead, 12 * 7 = 84, resulting in a sum of 12 + 7 = 19, which is better.\n\nIf I use smaller numbers, like 7 and 12, it stays the same. Trying another combination, 6 and 14 again gives 20.\n\nChecking 7 and 12, the sum remains 19. Finally, using 3 and 28 gives 31, which is higher than 19.\n\nTherefore, the set {12, 7} provides the smallest possible sum of 19.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll systematically explore the possible combinations of factors of 84.\n\n### Step 1: List All Factors of 84\nThe factors of 84 are:\n\\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Combinations\nWe need to find two or more distinct factors whose product is 84 and whose sum is minimized.\n\n"
