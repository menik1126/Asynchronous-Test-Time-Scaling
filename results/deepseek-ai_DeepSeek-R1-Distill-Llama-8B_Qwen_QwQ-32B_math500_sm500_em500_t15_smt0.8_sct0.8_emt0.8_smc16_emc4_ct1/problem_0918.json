Starting with the smallest possible integers, I consider 2, 3, and 7.\n\nCombining 2 and 3 gives 6, so the set includes 6, 7, and 2. The product is 6 × 7 × 2 = 84, and the sum is 6 + 7 + 2 = 15.\n\nI then check if breaking down further can result in a smaller sum. Breaking 6 into 2 and 3 gives the same set of numbers with a sum of 15.\n\nTrying to include 4 by breaking down 6 into 2 and 2 isn't possible since the integers must be distinct.\n\nAny other combinations either result in non-distinct integers or a higher sum.\n\nTherefore, the set with the smallest possible sum is {2, 3, 7}, and the least sum is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime factors:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Break down the prime factors into distinct integers:**\n   - Start with the smallest possible integers: 2, 3, and 7.\n   - Check if combining these factors can produce a valid set of distinct integers.\n\n3. **Create different combinations:**\n   - **Combination 1:** \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\), \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\) (Not valid as it exceeds 84 when multiplied by another integer)\n   - **Combination 2:** Use 2, 3, and 7 directly.\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\n     \\]\n     - **Sum:** \\(2 + 3 + 7 = 12\\)\n\n4. **Verify if a smaller sum is possible:**\n   - Any other combination either results in non-distinct integers or a higher sum.\n\n**Final"
