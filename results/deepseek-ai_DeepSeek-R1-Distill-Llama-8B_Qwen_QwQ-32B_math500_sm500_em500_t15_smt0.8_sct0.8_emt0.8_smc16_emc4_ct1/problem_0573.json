Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the three blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2! = 2.\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so there are 5! ways to arrange them. Similarly, the Republicans have 5 members, resulting in 5! arrangements. The Independent has only 1 member, so there's only 1 way to arrange them.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of arrangements for each block together and then by the number of ways to arrange the blocks around the table. This gives 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we can treat each party as a single unit or \"block\" since all members of a party must sit together. Since the table is circular, the arrangement of these blocks is considered unique only relative to each other and not by rotation.\n\n**Step 1: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table**\n\nThere are 3 blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. The number of distinct ways to arrange these blocks around a circular table is:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 1)! = 2! = 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Arrange Members Within Each Block**\n\n- **Democrats:** There are 5 members, so there are \\(5!\\) ways to arrange them.\n- **Republicans:** There are 5 members, so there are \\(5!\\) ways to arrange them.\n- **Independent:** There is 1 member, so there is only 1 way to arrange them.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**\n\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n\\[\n5! ="
