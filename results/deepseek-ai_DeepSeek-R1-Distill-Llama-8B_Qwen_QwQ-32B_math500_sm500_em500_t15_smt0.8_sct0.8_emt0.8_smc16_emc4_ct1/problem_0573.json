This means that for a linear arrangement, we have (n-1)! ways, but for a circular table, we need to fix one position to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nNext, I notice that the members of each party must sit together. This implies that each party can be thought of as a single unit or \"block.\" There are three such blocks: the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Independent.\n\nWith three blocks, the number of ways to arrange these blocks around a circular table is (3-1)! = 2! = 2. This accounts for the rotational symmetry of the circular table.\n\nHowever, each party within their block can have their members arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Independent is a single individual with only 1! arrangement.\n\nTo find the total number of seating arrangements, I multiply the number of arrangements of the blocks by the number of arrangements within each block: 2! * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nFinally, calculating this gives the total number of distinct seating arrangements around the circular table.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of seating the Senate committee around a circular table with the given conditions, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Circular Arrangement**\n- Since the table is circular, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered identical. This means we need to fix one position to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Treat Each Party as a Single Unit**\n- The problem states that all members of each party must sit next to each other. This allows us to treat each party as a single \"block\" or \"unit.\"\n- We have three such blocks: the 5 Democrats, the 5 Republicans, and the 1 Independent.\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table**\n- With 3 blocks, the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \\( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\). This adjustment is necessary because circular permutations are typically \\( (n-1)!"
