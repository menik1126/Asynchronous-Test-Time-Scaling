A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is formed by removing metal from each corner of a cube, and the cube has the shortest possible side length. My goal is to find the volume of the original cube in cubic inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is \\((4/3)\\pi r^3\\). With a radius of 3 inches, the volume becomes \\((4/3)\\pi (3)^3\\).\n\nThen, since the sphere is obtained by cutting off the cube's corners, each cut removes a small octant of the cube. An octant is one-eighth of the cube, so cutting off one corner removes \\(1/8\\) of the cube's volume from that corner.\n\nSince there are eight corners in a cube, the total volume removed from all corners is \\(8 \\times (1/8)\\) of the cube's volume, which equals the entire volume of the cube. This means that the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cube.\n\nFinally, to find the cube's volume, I'll set the cube's volume equal to the sphere's volume and solve for the cube's side length. Once I have the side length, I'll calculate the volume using the cube volume formula, \\(s^3\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is created by cutting off the corners of a cube.\n   - The cube has the shortest possible side length.\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - **Formula for the Volume of a Sphere:** \\((4/3)\\pi r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n   - **Given Radius:** 3 inches.\n   - **Sphere Volume:** \\((4/3)\\pi (3)^3 = (4/3)\\pi \\times 27 = 36\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n3. **Relate Sphere Volume to Cube Volume:**\n   - The sphere is formed by cutting off each corner of the cube.\n   - Each corner cut removes a small octant of the cube (1/8 of the cube's volume).\n   - Since a cube has 8 corners, the total volume removed is \\("
