Specifically, it takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3), and it takes (1, -3) to (7, -1). I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you apply a linear transformation (which is what a matrix does) to a line, the image is another line. So, instead of transforming each point on the original line, maybe I can find two points on the line and apply the transformation to them, then find the equation of the line connecting these transformed points. That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, the original line is y = 2x + 1. I'll pick two easy points on this line. Let me choose x = 0 and x = 1 because that should give me two simple points.\n\nWhen x = 0, y = 2(0) + 1 = 1. So, the point is (0, 1).\n\nWhen x = 1, y = 2(1) + 1 = 3. So, the point is (1, 3).\n\nNow, I need to apply the transformation matrix M to these two points. But I don't actually have the matrix M; instead, I have what it does to two specific vectors. So, I need to figure out the matrix M based on the given transformations.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when M is multiplied by a vector [x; y], it gives [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y].\n\nGiven that M takes (2, -1) to (9, 3), so:\n\n9 = a*2 + b*(-1)\n3 = c*2 + d*(-1)\n\nSimilarly, M takes (1, -3) to (7, -1):\n\n7 = a*1 + b*(-3)\n-1 = c*1 + d*(-3)\n\nSo now I have a system of equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3"

Let me take equations 1 and 3 to solve for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve equation 3 for a: a = 7 + 3b\n\nNow plug this into equation 1:\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9\n14 + 6b - b = 9\n14 + 5b = 9\n5b = 9 - 14\n5b = -5\nb = -1\n\nNow plug b = -1 into a = 7 + 3b:\n\na = 7 + 3*(-1) = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nSo, a = 4, b = -1\n\nNow let's solve for c and d using equations 2 and 4.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2c - d = 3\nFrom equation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve equation 4 for c:\n\nc = -1 + 3d\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(-1 + 3d) - d = 3\n-2 + 6d - d = 3\n-2 + 5d = 3\n5d = 3 + 2\n5d = 5\nd = 1\n\nNow plug d = 1 into c = -1 + 3d:\n\nc = -1 + 3*1 = -1 + 3 = 2\n\nSo, c = 2, d = 1\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\nM = [4   -1]\n        [2    1]\n\nOkay, so now I have the transformation matrix. Next, I need to apply this matrix to the two points I picked earlier: (0,1) and (1,3).\n\nLet's compute M*(0,1):\n\nM * [0; 1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 + 1*1] = [-1; 1]\n\nSo, the transformed point is (-1, 1).\n\nNow, let's compute M*(1,3):\n\nM * [1; 3] = [4"

            "output": "*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 + 1*3] = [4 - 3; 2 + 3] = [1; 5]\n\nSo, the transformed point is (1, 5).\n\nNow, I have two transformed points: (-1,1) and (1,5). Let me plot these in my mind. The original line was y = 2x + 1, and after transformation, these two points lie on the new line. I need to find the equation of this line.\n\nFirst, let me compute the slope (m). The slope between (-1,1) and (1,5) is:\n\nm = (5 - 1) / (1 - (-1)) = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the slope is 2, same as the original line. Interesting.\n\nNow, using point-slope form with point (-1,1):\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y - 1 = 2(x + 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny - 1 = 2x + 2\ny = 2x + 3\n\nWait, so the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under transformation M is y = 2x + 3.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes the slope can be misleading. Maybe I should plug in another point or check the calculations.\n\nLet me also compute M*(2, -1) to see what happens, but wait, (2,-1) is already taken to (9,3). Let's see if (9,3) satisfies y = 2x + 3.\n\nCompute 2*9 + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21. But 3 ≠ 21, so that point doesn't lie on the line. Hmm, okay, but that's expected because (2,-1) is not on our original line y=2x+1. Our original line was y=2x+1, so it's a different line.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead check another point on the original line. Let me pick another point on y=2x+1 and see where it maps. Let's say (0,1), which we already did, mapping to (-1,1). So, (-1,1) lies on y=2x+3: 2*(-"

            "output": "1)+3 = -2 +3 =1, which matches. The other point (1,3) maps to (1,5). Plugging into y=2x+3: 2*1 +3 =5, which matches. So that's good.\n\nWait, but let me check another point. Let's take x = -1 on the original line. Then y = 2*(-1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1. So the point (-1, -1). Let's apply M to this point.\n\nM * [-1; -1] = [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1); 2*(-1) + 1*(-1)] = [-4 +1; -2 -1] = [-3; -3]\n\nSo the transformed point is (-3, -3). Let's see if that's on y=2x+3. Plugging in x=-3: 2*(-3)+3 = -6 +3 = -3. Yep, that's correct. So that point is also on the line. So that seems consistent.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is y = 2x +3. But let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M\". Since linear transformations can sometimes change the slope, but in this case, the slope remained the same? That's interesting. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using parametric equations or something else, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the line parametrically and then apply the transformation. Let me try that.\n\nThe original line is y = 2x +1. Let me write this in parametric form. Let x = t, then y = 2t +1. So any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t +1). So the vector form is [t; 2t +1].\n\nNow, applying the matrix M to this vector:\n\nM * [t; 2t +1] = [4*t + (-1)*(2t +1); 2*t +1*(2t +1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2t + "

Let me express this as y in terms of x.\n\nFrom x = 2t -1, solve for t: t = (x +1)/2\n\nPlug into y: y = 4*( (x +1)/2 ) +1 = 2(x +1) +1 = 2x +2 +1 = 2x +3\n\nSo, again, I get y = 2x +3. Okay, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the image of the line y = 2x +1 under the transformation M is y = 2x +3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line under the transformation is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that transforms the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we need to find the image of the line \\(y = 2x + 1\\) under \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).\n\nFirst, we determine the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).
