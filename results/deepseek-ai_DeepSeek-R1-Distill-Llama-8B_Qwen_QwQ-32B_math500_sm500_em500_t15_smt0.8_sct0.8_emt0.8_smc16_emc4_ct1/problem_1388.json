I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix transformation. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the matrix M is transforming the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3), and (1, -3) to (7, -1). So, matrix M is a linear transformation, right? That means if I can figure out what M does to these two vectors, I can probably determine the entire transformation. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, I should be able to write down equations based on the given transformations.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when M multiplies the vector (2, -1), it gives (9, 3). That means:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  --> 2a - b = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3  --> 2c - d = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M multiplies (1, -3), it gives (7, -1). So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  --> a - 3b = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1  --> c - 3d = -1\n\nNow I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve this system of equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me start with the first two equations. Let's solve equation 3 for a:\n\nFrom equation 3: a = 7 + 3b\n\nNow plug this into equation 1:\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9\n14 + 6b - b = 9\n14 + 5b = 9\n5b = 9 -14\n5b = -5\nb = -1\n\nNow, plug b = -1 into equation 3:\n\na = 7 + 3*(-"

Hmm, how do I do that?\n\nI remember that to find the image of a line under a linear transformation, I can parameterize the line and then apply the transformation to each point, then express the result in terms of the original line.\n\nAlternatively, since lines are affine, I can think of it as the image of the line under M. If the line is given by y = mx + b, then the image under M would satisfy (Mv) = w, where v is a point on the line.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to represent the line as a vector equation and then apply the transformation. Let's see.\n\nThe line y=2x +1 can be parameterized. Let me choose a parameter t, so x = t, then y = 2t"

So, a general point on the line is (t, 2t +1).\n\nSince the transformation M is linear, then for any point (t, 2t +1), its image under M will be M*(t, 2t +1).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nSo, M*(t, 2t +1) = [4t -1, 2t +1] because:\n\nFirst component: 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) =4t -2t -1=2t -1\n\nWait, no, wait, wait.

Let me solve for y in terms of x.\n\nFrom the image point, x = 2t -1, so t = (x +1)/2\n\nThen, y =4t +1=4*(x +1)/2 +1=2*(x +1)+1=2x +2 +1=2x +3\n\nSo,"

So, perhaps the image is also an affine line, so we can write it as y = m x + b.\n\nAlternatively, another way to do this is to consider that the image of the line can be found by applying the transformation to two points on the line and then finding the equation of the line through those two images.\n\nLet me try that method as a check.\n\nFirst, pick two points on the original line y =2x +1.\n\nLet me choose x=0: then y=1, so point (0,1).\n\nAnother point, say x=1: y=3, so (1,3).\n\nThird point, maybe x=-1: y= -2 +1 = -1, so (-1, -1). Let's use two points.\n\nFirst, take (0,1):\n\nApply M to (0,1):\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 + (-1)*1, 2*0 +1*1] = (-1, 1)\n\nSecond, take (1,3):\n\nM*(1,3) = [4*1 + (-1)*3, 2*1 +1*3] = (4 -3, 2 +3) = (1,5)\n\nThird, let's take (-1, -1):\n\nM*(-1, -1) = [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1), 2*(-1) +1*(-1)] = (-4 +1, -2 -1) = (-3, -3)\n\nNow, let's see if these points lie on the line y=2x +3.\n\nCheck first point (-1,1):\n\nPlug into y=2x +3: 2*(-1) +3 = -2 +3 =1. So yes, ( -1,1) is on the line.\n\nSecond point (1,5):\n\n2*1 +3 =5. So yes, (1,5) is on the line.\n\nThird point (-3, -3):\n\n2*(-3) +3 =-6 +3 =-3. So yes, that"

So, that seems to confirm that y=2x +3 is the image.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So, the line is transformed by the matrix M, and the image is y=2x +3. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of transformation of the direction vector and the point.\n\nThe original line has a direction vector (1,2) because the slope is 2, so direction vector is (1,2). After transformation, the direction vector becomes M*(1,2)= [4*1 + (-1)*2, 2*1 +1*2] = (4-2,2+2)=(2,4). So, the direction vector of the image line is (2,4), which has a slope of 4/2=2. So, the image line has the same slope, which is consistent.\n\nNow, the original line passes through (0,1), and the image passes through ( -1,1). Wait, but in the first approach, the image of (0,1) is (-1,1), and the image of (1,3) is (1,5). So, that suggests that the image line is y=2x + (something). Let me compute it.\n\nWait, let's use the points (-1,1) and (1,5). The slope between these two points is (5-1)/(1 - (-1))=4/2=2, as expected.\n\nSo, the equation of the line through (-1,1) with slope 2 is y -1=2(x +1), so y=2x +2 +1=2x +3. That confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using two points ( -3, -3) and (1,5): slope is (5 - (-3))/(1 - (-3))=8/4=2, same as before.\n\nThen the equation: y - (-3)=2(x - (-3)) → y +3=2x +6 → y=2x +3.\n\nSo, all methods converge to the same equation.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach"
