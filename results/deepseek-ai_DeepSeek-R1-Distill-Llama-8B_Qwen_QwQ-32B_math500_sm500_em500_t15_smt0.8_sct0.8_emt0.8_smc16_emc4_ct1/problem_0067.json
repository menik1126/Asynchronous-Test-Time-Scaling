I need to find the maximum value that the greatest common divisor of these two expressions can take. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) for some positive integer \\( n \\).\n\nOne method I recall for finding the gcd of two numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeatedly applying division and taking remainders until we get a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). So, we need to compute \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, I can write:\n\n\\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\).\n\nTo apply the Euclidean algorithm, I can subtract multiples of one from the other to simplify. Let's see, if I multiply \\( a \\) by 2, I get \\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\). Then, subtract \\( b \\) from that:\n\n\\( 2n + 14 - (2n + 1) = 13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 2a - b = 13 \\), which implies that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, 13) \\).\n\nNow, since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that 13 divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nSo, I need to check if there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) such that both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13.\n\nLet me set \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\). This implies that \\( n"

            "output": " \\equiv -7 \\pmod{13} \\), or equivalently, \\( n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13} \\) because \\( -7 + 13 = 6 \\).\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13} \\) into the second expression \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\n\\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 2(6) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\).\n\nGreat! So when \\( n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13} \\), both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13. Therefore, the gcd is at least 13.\n\nTo confirm that 13 is indeed the greatest possible value, I should check if there's a possibility of a higher gcd. However, since 13 is a prime number and our computation via the Euclidean algorithm only yields 1 or 13, there's no higher common divisor possible. \n\nLet me verify with an example. Let's pick \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n- \\( n + 7 = 13 \\)\n- \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\)\n\nAnother example, take \\( n = 6 + 13 = 19 \\):\n\n- \\( n + 7 = 26 \\)\n- \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(26, 39) = 13 \\)\n\nAnd another one: \\( n = 6 + 26 = 32 \\):\n\n- \\( n + 7 = 39 \\)\n- \\( 2n + 1 = 65 \\)\n- \\( \\gcd(39, 65) = 13 \\)\n\nIt seems consistent. So, 13 is achievable and it's the highest possible because any higher number would have to be a multiple of 13, but since we can only get 1 or 13 as the gcd, 13 is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\), we apply the Euclidean algorithm. Let \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\("
