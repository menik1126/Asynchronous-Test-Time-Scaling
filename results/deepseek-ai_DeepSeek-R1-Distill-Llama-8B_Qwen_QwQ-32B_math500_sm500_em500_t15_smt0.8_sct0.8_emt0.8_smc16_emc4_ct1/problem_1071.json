So, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter, and a regular octagon has 8 sides, I can set up the equation 8s = 96 to find the length of each side of the octagon. Solving for s gives s = 12 cm.\n\nTherefore, each side of the octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - The regular hexagon has a side length of 16 cm.\n   - Both the hexagon and the octagon have the same perimeter.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has 6 sides.\n   - Perimeter of the hexagon = Number of sides × Side length\n   - Perimeter = \\(6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Sides of the Octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has 8 sides.\n   - Let \\(s\\) be the side length of the octagon.\n   - Perimeter of the octagon = \\(8 \\times s\\)\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation Since Perimeters Are Equal:**\n   - \\(8s = 96\\)\n\n5. **Solve for \\(s\\):**\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
