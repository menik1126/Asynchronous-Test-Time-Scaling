            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon given its side length of 16 cm. Since a hexagon has 6 sides, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, I'll find the perimeter of the regular octagon. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so if each side of the octagon is 's' cm long, the perimeter will be 8s cm.\n\nSince both shapes have the same perimeter, I'll set the perimeters equal to each other: 8s = 96 cm. Solving for 's' by dividing both sides by 8 gives s = 12 cm. Therefore, each side of the octagon measures 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that both the regular hexagon and the regular octagon have the same perimeter. Let's determine the length of each side of the octagon.\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the perimeter of the octagon:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let each side of the octagon be \\( s \\) cm.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 8s \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the perimeters equal to each other:**\n   \n   Since the perimeters are equal,\n   \n   \\[\n   8s = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( s \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{96}{8} \\, \\text{cm} = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** Each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm."
