Hmm, interesting. I remember that gcd is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I need to figure out what's the largest possible number that can divide both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) for some positive integer \\( n \\).\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. That's the method where you subtract multiples of one number from the other to find the gcd. So, the Euclidean algorithm states that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). Applying that here, let me set \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\). Let me compute \\( a - 2b \\) because \\( 2b = 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\). Wait, subtracting \\( 2b \\) from \\( a \\) would give \\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). Hmm, so \\( a - 2b = -13 \\). That means \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\) because \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - 2b) \\) if \\( 2b < a \\), but in this case, \\( 2b = 2n + 14 \\) which is definitely less than \\( 2n + 1 \\) when \\( n \\) is positive. Wait, no, actually \\( 2n + 14 \\) is greater than \\( 2n + 1 \\) because 14 is bigger than 1. So, maybe I need to rearrange that.\n\nActually, let me correct that. The Euclidean algorithm tells us that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b"

Let me compute how many times \\( b \\) goes into \\( a \\). So, \\( 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13 \\). Therefore, \\( 2n + 1 = 2b - 13 \\). So \\( a = 2b - 13 \\). Therefore, \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nWait, so that means the gcd is either 13 or a divisor of 13. Since 13 is a prime number, its divisors are only 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible gcd is 13, provided that \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13.\n\nSo, if I can find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 7 \\) is divisible by 13, then the gcd will be 13. Let me set \\( n + 7 = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. Then, \\( n = 13k - 7 \\). Plugging this back into \\( 2n + 1 \\), we get \\( 2*(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13*(2k - 1) \\). Therefore, \\( 2n + 1 \\) is also a multiple of 13 when \\( n = 13k - 7 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\) for these values of \\( n \\). Since 13 is the largest divisor here, this must be the greatest possible value of the gcd.\n\nLet me double-check with a specific example to make sure I haven't made a mistake. Let's choose \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( n = 13*1 - 7 = 6 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 12 +"

            "output": " 1 = 13 \\). So, gcd(13, 13) is 13, which checks out.\n\nLet me try another value, say \\( k = 2 \\). Then, \\( n = 13*2 - 7 = 26 - 7 = 19 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 \\). The gcd of 26 and 39 is 13, since 26 = 2*13 and 39 = 3*13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if there's a case where the gcd could be larger than 13. Suppose that \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = d \\), where \\( d > 13 \\). Then, \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) divides any linear combination of these, such as \\( 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). So, \\( d \\) divides 13. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. Hence, \\( d \\) cannot be greater than 13. Therefore, 13 is indeed the greatest possible value.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13. This is because when using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the gcd reduces to 13. By choosing specific values of \\( n \\) that make both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) multiples of 13, we confirm that 13 is achievable and is indeed the greatest possible value.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Let \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\).\n2. Apply the Euclidean algorithm: \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - 2b) \\).\n3. Calculate \\( a - 2b = (2n + 1) -"
