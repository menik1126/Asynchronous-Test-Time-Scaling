            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this quadratic polynomial problem. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have a quadratic polynomial P(x) with real coefficients. It satisfies the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers x. Additionally, we're given that P(11) = 181, and we need to find P(16).\n\nHmm, so P(x) is a quadratic that's squeezed between two other quadratics for all real x. That must mean that P(x) touches both of these functions at certain points, maybe? Or perhaps they don't touch at all but P(x) is just always in between them.\n\nSince both bounding functions are quadratic, their difference will be a quadratic as well. Maybe I can find the difference between the upper and lower bounds to figure out the constraints on P(x).\n\nLet me write down the inequalities again:\n\nLower bound: \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n\nUpper bound: \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\)\n\nSo, subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound:\n\n\\( (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\)\n\nAh, that simplifies to \\( (x - 1)^2 \\). That's a perfect square, so the difference between the upper and lower bounds is a square of (x - 1). That tells me that the range between the two quadratics is always non-negative because squares are always non-negative. So, for all real x, \\( (x - 1)^2 \\geq 0 \\), which makes sense.\n\nBut how does this help me find P(x)? Well, since P(x) is between these two quadratics, the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be equal to some multiple of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\), or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think. The upper bound is 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3, and the lower bound is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. Let me denote:\n\nLet me define the lower function as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + "

So,\n\nP(x) - L(x) \u2265 0,\n\nand\n\nU(x) - P(x) \u2265 0.\n\nTherefore, both of these expressions must be non-negative quadratics (or linear, but since P(x) is quadratic, their difference would be quadratic). Wait, actually, since L(x) and U(x) are both quadratics, and P(x) is quadratic, then P(x) - L(x) is a quadratic, and U(x) - P(x) is also a quadratic.\n\nMoreover, since these differences are non-negative for all real x, they must be perfect squares or have a leading coefficient non-negative and discriminant \u2264 0. Hmm, but since the difference between U(x) and L(x) is (x - 1)^2, which is a perfect square, maybe P(x) is exactly halfway between them? But not necessarily, because the problem states that P(x) is between them, but not necessarily exactly in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) coincides with both L(x) and U(x) at some points, so that the inequalities become equalities there. Since the difference between U(x) and L(x) is (x - 1)^2, which is zero only at x = 1, so maybe P(x) touches both L(x) and U(x) at x = 1?\n\nLet me check that. Let's plug x = 1 into L(x) and U(x):\n\nL(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1,\n\nU(1) = 2(1)^2 -4(1) +3 = 2 -4 +3 = 1.\n\nAh! So at x = 1, both the upper and lower bounds are equal to 1. Therefore, P(1) must also equal 1, because it's sandwiched between them. So P(1) = 1.\n\nThat's a key point. So P(1) = 1.\n\nAdditionally, we know that P(11) = 18"

            "output": ". So, with two points on a quadratic, we can determine the quadratic.\n\nWait, but wait. Since P(x) is a quadratic, it's determined uniquely by its value at three points, but here we have a condition that it's bounded by those two quadratics.\n\nBut I think we can represent P(x) as L(x) + k*(x - 1)^2, where k is some constant. Because the difference between U(x) and L(x) is (x - 1)^2, so if P(x) is somewhere between them, the amount by which it's above L(x) is proportional to this square term.\n\nBut let me think about it. Let me denote P(x) = L(x) + (x - 1)^2 * k, where k is between 0 and 1 because P(x) must be below U(x) which is L(x) + (x - 1)^2.\n\nWait, because U(x) = L(x) + (x - 1)^2. So, if P(x) is between L(x) and U(x), then:\n\nP(x) = L(x) + k*(x - 1)^2,\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1.\n\nTherefore, since P(x) is a quadratic, and (x - 1)^2 is a quadratic, the product is quadratic, so P(x) is determined by this k.\n\nAdditionally, since we know that P(1) = 1, which is equal to L(1) because when x=1, (x - 1)^2 = 0. So that works out.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + k*(x - 1)^2.\n\nNow, let's write that out:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + k*(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1).\n\nExpanding that, we get:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + kx\u00b2 - 2kx + k.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nP(x) = (1 + k)x\u00b2 + (-2 - 2k)x + (2 + k).\n\nSo, P(x) is of the form a x\u00b2 + b x + c, where:\n\na = 1 + k,\n\nb = -2 - 2k,\n\nc = 2 + k.\n\nWe know"
