            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that for all real numbers x, the value of P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. Also, I know that P(11) is 181, and I need to find P(16). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, I can write it in the general form: P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients that I need to find. So, my goal is to determine a, b, and c.\n\nBut before I get into that, there's this inequality given: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real x. This means that no matter what x is, P(x) is always greater than or equal to x² - 2x + 2 and less than or equal to 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nLet me write that down as inequalities:\n\n1. P(x) ≥ x² - 2x + 2\n2. P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nSubstituting the general form of P(x) into these inequalities gives:\n\n1. ax² + bx + c ≥ x² - 2x + 2\n2. ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nNow, to satisfy these inequalities for all real x, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be such that the inequality holds everywhere. So, let me rearrange both inequalities to bring all terms to one side.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\nax² + bx + c - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(ax² - x²) + (bx + 2x) + (c - 2) ≥ 0\n(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n\nax² + bx + c - (2x² - 4x + 3) ≤ 0\n\nSimplify"

(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n2. (a - 2)x² + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) ≤ 0 for all x.\n\nSince these quadratics must hold for all real x, they must open upwards or be zero (for the first inequality) and open downwards or be zero (for the second inequality). Also, since quadratics can only be non-negative or non-positive for all x if they have no real roots (i.e., discriminant is zero or negative) and their leading coefficients determine the direction.\n\nLet me analyze the first inequality: (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nFor a quadratic to be always non-negative, the leading coefficient must be non-negative, and the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero. Similarly, for the second inequality, the quadratic must be always non-positive, so the leading coefficient must be non-positive, and the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, for the first inequality:\n\n1. Leading coefficient: (a - 1) ≥ 0 ⇒ a - 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ 1\n2. Discriminant: D1 = (b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n\n1. Leading coefficient: (a - 2) ≤ 0 ⇒ a - 2 ≤ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 2\n2. Discriminant: D2 = (b + 4)² - 4*(a - 2)*(c - 3) ≤ 0\n\nSo, from the first condition on a, we have a ≥ 1, and from the second, a ≤ 2.

That would mean that the inequalities are tight, so the quadratic expressions are perfect squares.

Let me set that.\n\nSo, first quadratic:\n\n(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) = k(x - m)^2, where k = (a - 1) must be non-negative (since the quadratic is non-negative).

The quadratic is a negative multiple of a square, so it's always ≤ 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both quadratics are perfect squares with zero discriminant. Let me proceed with that.\n\nLet me first handle the first quadratic:\n\nLet me denote Q1(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2). Since Q1(x) is non-negative for all x and discriminant is zero, so discriminant D1 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) = (a - 2)x² + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) is non-positive for all x,"

Also, discriminant must be ≤0.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) - (x² -2x +2) has leading coefficient (a -1) ≥0, so a ≥1, and discriminant ≤0.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal case is when both quadratics have discriminant zero, but in that case, as we saw, the P(x) would be exactly the lower or upper bound, but since P(11) is given as 181, which is between the two bounds evaluated at 11.\n\nWait, let me compute the lower and upper bounds at x=11.\n\nLower bound at x=11: 11² -2*11 +2 = 121 -22 +2 = 101.\n\nUpper bound at x=11: 2*(121) -4*11 +3 = 242 -44 +3 = 201.\n\nSo, 101 ≤ P(11)=181 ≤201. So that's okay. So P(11)=181 is between them, so P(x) is not equal to either bound at x=11, so the quadratics (the differences) must be positive there, so their discriminants can't be zero. Hmm, so my previous approach assuming discriminants zero might not work because the inequalities are strict at x=11.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the quadratics (the differences) must have discriminants strictly negative, so they never touch the x-axis, hence always positive or always negative.\n\nTherefore, the discriminants must be negative, not just zero. So, D1 <0 and D2 <0.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things because now we have inequalities instead of equalities. So, perhaps I need to set up the equations with the discriminants being negative, but also use the condition P"

Let me write down the two discriminants:\n\nFrom Q1(x) = (a -1)x² + (b +2)x + (c -2) ≥0 for all x ⇒ a -1 ≥0, and D1 = (b +2)^2 -4*(a -1)*(c -2) <0.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) = (a -2)x² + (b +4)x + (c -3) ≤0 for all x ⇒ a -2 ≤0, and D2 = (b +4)^2 -4*(a -2)*(c -3) <0.\n\nNow, with these inequalities, I have a system of inequalities and a known value at x=11, so maybe I can write down more equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the problem in terms of P(x) being a quadratic lying between two others, and use P(11)=181 to solve for a, b, c.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe if I set up P(x) as a convex combination of the two bounds, but that might not necessarily be the case unless the coefficients are particular.\n\nWait, let me write P(x) = (1 - t)x² -2x +2 + t(2x² -4x +3), where t is between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily hold because P(x) is a quadratic, and so linear combination would still be a quadratic, but the coefficients may not fit.\n\nWait, let me try that.

That's interesting. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x -1)^2, which is always non-negative, as expected.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound is always exactly the lower bound plus (x-1)^2. So, U(x) = L(x) + (x -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, since P(x) is between L(x) and U(x), then P(x) can be written as L(x) + k(x)*(x -1)^2, where k(x) is a function between 0 and 1 for all x. But since P(x) is a quadratic, then k(x) must be a constant, because otherwise, if k(x) is a function, then the term k(x)*(x-1)^2 would introduce higher degree terms unless k(x) is a constant.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Since P(x) is quadratic, and L(x) is quadratic, then (x -1)^2 is quadratic, so if we have P(x) = L(x) + k*(x -1)^2, then k must be a constant, because otherwise, if k is a function, it would have to be a constant to keep P(x) quadratic.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = L(x) + k*(x -1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and 1 (since P(x) is between L(x) and U(x)). Because when k=0, P(x)=L(x), and when k=1, P(x)=U(x).\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (x² -2x +2) + k*(x² -2x +1).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nP(x) = x² -2x +2 +k x² -2k x +k.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 +k)x² + (-2 -2k)x + (2 +k).\n\nTherefore, P(x) is a quadratic with coefficients:\n\na = 1 +k,\n\n"
