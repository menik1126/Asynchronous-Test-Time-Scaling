Let me see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the equation, I notice that there are exponential terms with different bases: 3 and 10. Also, 3^{2x} can be written as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So, maybe rewriting it could help.\n\nSo, rewriting 3^{2x} as 9^x, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, okay, now I have 9^x and 10^x. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to make it easier to handle.\n\nLet me subtract 10^x from both sides to get 9^x - 10^x + 19 = 0. Wait, that might not be the most useful step. Alternatively, I can move the 10^x to the other side: 9^x + 19 = 10^x, which is the original form. Maybe instead of subtracting, I can divide both sides by 10^x to make the equation in terms of (9/10)^x.\n\nLet me try that. So, (9^x)/(10^x) + 19/(10^x) = 1. That simplifies to (9/10)^x + 19/(10^x) = 1. Hmm, but 19/(10^x) is still a bit tricky. Maybe I can let y = (10/9)^x or something similar to make it easier. Wait, maybe I should let t = (10/9)^x, since 10/9 is greater than 1, and that could simplify things.\n\nLet me define t = (10/9)^x. Then, (9/10)^x is equal to 1/t. Also, since (10/9)^x = t, taking the natural log of both sides gives x*ln(10/9) = ln(t), so x = ln(t)/ln(10/9). Maybe that can be useful later.\n\nSo, substituting back into the original equation, 9^x + 19 = 10^x becomes (9^x) + 19"

So, seems like it's only crossing once. Therefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check at x=2.1:\n\n3^{4.2}=3^4 *3^0.2\u224881 *1.2457\u2248100.8. 10^{2.1}=10^2 *10^0.1\u2248100 *1.2589\u2248125.89. So f(2.1)=100.8+19 -125.89\u2248(119.8 -125.89)= -6.09<0.\n\nSo, from x=2 to x=2.1, f(x) goes from 0 to -6.09, so f(x) is decreasing there.\n\nHence, there's only one solution at x=2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x \\), we can rewrite \\( 3^{2x} \\) as \\( 9^x \\), leading to the equation \\( 9^x + 19 = 10^x \\). By testing integer values, we find that \\( x = 2 \\) satisfies the equation, as \\( 9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100 \\) and \\( 10^2 = 100 \\).\n\nTo determine if there are other solutions, we analyze the"
