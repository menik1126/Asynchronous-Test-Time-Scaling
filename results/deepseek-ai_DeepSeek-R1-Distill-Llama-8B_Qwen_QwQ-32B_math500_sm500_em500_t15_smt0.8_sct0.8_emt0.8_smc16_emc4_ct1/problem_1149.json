First, I'll identify the coefficients for \\(x\\) and the constant term from each part of the factored form.\n\nFrom \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\), when I expand this, the \\(x\\) terms will multiply to give \\(ABx^2\\), and the constant terms will combine to give \\(-8 \\times 3 = -24\\), which matches the original expression.\n\nNext, I'll set up the equations for the coefficients. Since the middle term is \\(-x\\), the product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be 10. Additionally, the constant term is \\(-24\\), which is already accounted for by the \\(-8\\) and \\(3\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(A \\times B = 10\\). The possible integer pairs \\((A, B)\\) that satisfy this are \\((1, 10)\\), \\((2, 5)\\), \\((5, 2)\\), and \\((10, 1)\\). Calculating \\(AB + B\\) for each pair, the minimum value is 20 when \\(A=2\\) and \\(B=5\\).\n</think>\n\nTo factor the quadratic expression \\( 10x^2 - x - 24 \\) into the form \\( (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are integers, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Coefficients:**\n   - When expanding \\( (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \\), the \\( x^2 \\) term is \\( ABx^2 \\). Therefore, \\( AB = 10 \\).\n   - The constant term is \\( -24 \\), which matches the given expression.\n\n2. **Find Integer Pairs \\( (A, B) \\) Such That \\( AB = 10 \\):**\n   - Possible integer pairs are:\n     - \\( (1, 10) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 5) \\)\n     - \\( (5, 2) \\)\n     - \\( (10, 1)"
