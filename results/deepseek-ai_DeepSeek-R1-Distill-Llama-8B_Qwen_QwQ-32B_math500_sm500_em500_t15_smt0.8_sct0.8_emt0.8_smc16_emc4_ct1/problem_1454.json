            "output": "Alright, I need to solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. So, the equation has both \\(3^{2x}\\) and \\(10^x\\), which are exponential terms. My first thought is to see if I can rewrite these terms in a way that makes the equation easier to solve.\n\nI notice that \\(3^{2x}\\) can be written as \\((3^x)^2\\). That seems helpful because both sides of the equation would then have terms with \\(x\\) in the exponent. So, let me rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\n(3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x\n\\]\n\nNow, I want to get all the terms involving \\(x\\) on one side so I can potentially factor or use logarithms. Let me subtract \\(10^x\\) from both sides to move that term to the left:\n\n\\[\n(3^x)^2 - 10^x + 19 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me let \\(y = 3^x\\). Then, since \\(3^{2x} = (3^x)^2\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10^x + 19 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I still have \\(10^x\\) in the equation, and \\(y = 3^x\\). Maybe I can express \\(10^x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). Since \\(10^x\\) is the same as \\((10^{x})\\) and \\(y = 3^x\\), I could take logarithms to relate them, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of both sides at some point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to express everything in terms of the same base or find a common exponential term. Let me see if I can find a substitution that helps.\n\nAnother approach could be to test for integer values of \\(x\\) to see if they satisfy the equation. That might give me a clue or even the exact solution. Let's try plugging in some small integer values for \\(x\\).\n\nStarting with \\(x = 0\\):\nLeft side: \\(3^{0} + 19 = 1 +"

Let's try x=1.5:\n\nx=1.5: 3^(3) +19 = 27 +19=46. 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)=about 31.62. So 46>31. So left is higher here.\n\nWait, at x=1, left is 28 and right is 10. At x=2, both 100.
