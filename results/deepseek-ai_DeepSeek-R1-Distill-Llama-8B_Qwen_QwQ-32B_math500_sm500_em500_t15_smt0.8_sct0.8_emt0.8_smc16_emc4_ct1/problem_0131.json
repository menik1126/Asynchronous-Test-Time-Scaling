            "output": "To find the units digit of 4\\$, I'll start by understanding the definition of the superfactorial. The superfactorial of a number n, denoted as n\\$, is a tower of exponentials where each level is an factorial. For n=4, the superfactorial is 4!^4!^4!^4!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the factorials:\n- 4! = 24.\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression:\n4\\$ = 24^24^24^24.\n\nSince the units digit of powers often follows a pattern, I'll determine the units digit of 24^something. The base 24 has a units digit of 4, and I'm interested in the pattern of 4 raised to various exponents.\n\nExamining the pattern:\n- 4^1 ends with 4.\n- 4^2 ends with 6.\n- 4^3 ends with 4.\n- 4^4 ends with 6.\n\nThis pattern repeats every 2 exponents. So, the units digit cycles between 4 and 6 depending on whether the exponent is odd or even.\n\nNext, I need to determine if the exponent in each level is odd or even. Starting from the top:\n- The top exponent is also 24, which is even.\n- Moving down, each exponent will also be even because 24 is even and 24^something is even.\n\nThis means all the exponents in the tower are even numbers. Therefore, each level of the superfactorial exponent will result in a units digit of 6.\n\nFinally, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(4\\$\\), we'll analyze the structure of the superfactorial and apply properties of exponents and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Superfactorial Definition\nThe superfactorial \\(n\\$\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nn\\ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\n\\]\nFor \\(n = 4\\):\n\\[\n4\\ = 4!^{{4!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{4!}}}}} = 24^{24^{24^{24}}}\n\\]\n\n### Step"

            "output": " 2: Simplify the Base and Exponents\nThe base of the tower is \\(24\\), which has a units digit of \\(4\\). To find the units digit of \\(24^{24^{24^{24}}}\\), we focus on \\(4^{24^{24^{24}}}\\) modulo \\(10\\) (since the units digit depends only on the value modulo \\(10\\)).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pattern of Units Digits for Powers of 4\nThe units digit cycles every 2 exponents:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4^1 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n4^2 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n4^3 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n4^4 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}, \\text{ and so on}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe pattern is \\(4, 6\\), repeating every 2. Thus, the units digit of \\(4^k\\) depends on whether \\(k\\) is even or odd:\n- If \\(k\\) is even, the units digit is \\(6\\).\n- If \\(k\\) is odd, the units digit is \\(4\\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Parity of the Exponent(s) Modulo 2\nWe need to determine if the exponent tower \\(24^{24^{24}}\\) is even or odd. Since \\(24\\) is even, any power of \\(24\\) is still even. Therefore, every exponent in the tower (starting from the top) is even:\n\\[\n24^{24^{24}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n\\]\nThus, the exponent \\(24^{24^{24}}\\) is even.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Pattern to Find the Units Digit\nSince the exponent \\(24^{24^{24}}\\) is even, the units digit of \\(4^{24^{24^{24}}}\\) follows the pattern above and is \\(6\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
