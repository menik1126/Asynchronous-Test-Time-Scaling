That sounds complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the superfactorial definition correctly. For a number n, the superfactorial is n! raised to the power of n!, which is then raised to the power of itself n! times. So, for 4$$, it would be 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with the exponent being 4! four times. Wait, actually, no. The definition says it's n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}, which has n! as the exponent, but the number of exponents is not specified. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me check the definition again. The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n! raised to the power of n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}, with the exponent having n! as its base and the number of exponents is n!. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!^...))) with four exponents? Or maybe it's a tower of exponents with 4! appearing n times? Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look it up properly. No, wait, the user just gave the definition as n\\$ = n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}. So the base is n!, and the exponent is another tower of n!s, but the number of exponents is not specified. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's a tower of n!s of height n? So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!^4!))). Or maybe it's a tower of n!s with the same number of exponents as the base? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the definition is better understood as a tower of exponents where the base is n! and the exponent is a tower of n!s,"

The problem says \"underbrace n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}_{n!}\", so the underbrace is indicating that the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nOh, right! The underbrace is indicating that the exponent tower has n! number of n! terms. So for n=4, the superfactorial is 4! raised to the power of 4!^4!^...^4! with a total of 4! (which is 24) terms in the exponent tower. Wait, that's a tower of 24 4!'s? That's an astronomically large number. But we just need the units digit. So maybe there's a pattern in the units digit when dealing with exponents modulo 10.\n\nAlright, so the problem is to find the units digit of 4$$, which is 24\\$ (since 4! = 24). Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is 4, so n\\$ is 4! raised to a tower of 4! terms. Wait, no, the definition says n\\$ is equal to n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of ... with the number of exponents being n!.\n\nWait, let me parse the definition again carefully. The problem states: \"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\". The underbrace is underneath the entire exponent tower, and the label is n!. So that means the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the superfactorial is 4!^(4!^(4!^(...^4!))) with a total of 4! = 24 terms in the exponent tower. So the tower has 24 copies of 4!.\n\nTherefore, 4\\$ is a tower of 24 24s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4! is 24, so each term in the tower is 24. So the superfactorial is 24^(24^(24"

Calculating that directly is impossible, so we have to find some pattern or use modular arithmetic to find the units digit.\n\nBut let's start by considering the base, which is 24. The units digit of 24 is 4. So the base's units digit is 4, which will influence the final result.\n\nSo we need to compute 24^E, where E is the exponent tower of 24s with height 24, modulo 10. Because the units digit is equivalent to the number mod 10.\n\nSo, first, let's compute 24 mod 10, which is 4. So any power of 24, we can reduce the base to 4 first. So 24^E mod 10 = 4^E mod 10.\n\nNow, we need to compute 4^E mod 10. Since 4 has a cycle of 2 when raised to exponents mod 10. Let's recall that:\n\n4^1 = 4 mod 10\n\n4^2 = 16 ≡ 6 mod 10\n\n4^3 = 4*6 = 24 ≡ 4 mod 10\n\n4^4 = 4*4 = 16 ≡ 6 mod 10\n\nSo the pattern cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod 10 depends on whether E is odd or even. If E is odd, it's 4 mod 10; if even, 6 mod 10.\n\nSo our task reduces to finding whether E, the exponent, is odd or even, because that will determine the units digit of 4^E, which is either 4 or 6.\n\nNow, E is the exponent tower 24^24^24^... with 24 copies of 24, meaning E is 24^24^24^... with 24 terms. So E is a tower of 24 24s, 24 tetrated 24 times.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more precisely, E is the result of starting with 24 and then exponentiating 24 by itself 24 times. So E = 24^24^24^... with 24 exponents, which is a tower of 24 24s, 24"

Therefore, the entire exponent tower E is even, because 24^anything is even. So E is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the exponent E is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 terms. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will be even. So the entire exponent E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6, since even exponents on 4 give 6 mod 10.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip steps. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the exponent modulo the period of 4's cycle mod 10. Since the cycle length is 2, the exponent E mod 2 will determine the result. Because 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2, so if we can find E mod 2, then:\n\nIf E mod 2 is 1, then 4^E mod 10 is 4.\n\nIf E mod 2 is 0, then 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute E mod 2. Since E is the exponent tower of 24s, which is 24^24^...^24 (24 terms). Let's see:\n\nFirst, 24 mod 2 is 0. So any power of 24 is 0 mod 2. Therefore, the entire exponent tower E is 0 mod 2, i.e., even. Therefore, E mod 2 = 0, so 4^E mod 10 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6. So the answer is 6?\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler case. Let's see, for example, if the exponent was 1, then 4^1 mod10 is 4. If exponent is 2, 4^2 mod10 is 6. So yes, even exponents give 6, odd give"

So let's see:\n\nSince each 24 is even, when we compute 24^anything, it's even, so E is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps the exponent E is more than just even; maybe I need to consider Euler's theorem or something. Because when dealing with exponentiation mod something, sometimes the exponents can be reduced modulo φ(n), where φ is Euler's totient function.\n\nIn our case, the modulus is 10, and φ(10) = 4, since 10 has prime factors 2 and 5, so φ(10) = 10*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/5) = 4.\n\nSo by Euler's theorem, for a and n coprime, a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n.\n\nBut in our case, the base is 4 and modulus is 10. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime (they share a factor of 2), Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Therefore, we can't reduce the exponent modulo φ(10) = 4 in that way. Instead, we had to look for patterns in powers of 4 mod 10.\n\nAs observed earlier, 4 has a cycle of 2 mod 10. So 4^k mod 10 cycles as 4,6,4,6,... So the result depends on whether k is odd or even. So we just need to determine if the exponent E is even or odd.\n\nAs established, E is even, so 4^E mod10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something in the exponent calculation. Let me consider how E is built up.\n\nE is a tower of 24 24s, so E = 24^24^24^...^24, 24 levels tall. But when computing E mod 2, we can note that any number mod 2 is equivalent to whether it's even or odd.\n\nSince 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, regardless of the exponent. So 24^k is"

Units digit 1.\n\nn=2: 2\\$ is 2!^(2!^2!) with 2! =2 terms. So 2! is 2, so the tower is 2^(2^2). 2^2 is 4, so 2^4 =16. Units digit 6. Which matches the formula: since exponent is 4, even, so 2^4 mod10 is 6. Wait, but here the base is 2, not 4. Wait, but in the problem, for n=2, the superfactorial would be 2!^(2!^2!) = 2^(2^2) = 16, which has units digit 6. So that works.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=3, let's see. 3\\$ is 6^(6^6^... with 6 terms. Wait, 3! is 6, so the tower has 6 terms. So the exponent is 6^6^6^6^6^6. That's a huge number, but to find the units digit of 6^(that). Since 6 raised to any power is always 6 mod10. So the units digit would be 6. So 3\\$ has units digit 6.

Therefore, 4^E mod10 =6.\n\nWait, but perhaps the E reduces further? Let me think. Wait, perhaps the exponent E is a tower so large that it's more than just even. But since we only need E mod2, and 24 is even, any tower of 24s will be even, because even^anything is even.\n\nSo, regardless of how many exponents, if any term in the exponent tower is even, then the entire exponent is even, right?
