Mr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of the 7. This can be done using the combination formula, which is written as C(7,3).\n\nThen, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4. Similarly, this is done using the combination formula, C(4,2).\n\nAfter obtaining the number of ways to choose the boys and girls separately, I'll multiply these two results together to get the total number of ways to form the group.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer in a box as the solution to the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \n   The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) items from \\( n \\) items without considering the order is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \n   Applying the combination formula again:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of ways to form the group:**\n   \n   Since the choices of boys and girls are independent, we'll multiply the two results:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
