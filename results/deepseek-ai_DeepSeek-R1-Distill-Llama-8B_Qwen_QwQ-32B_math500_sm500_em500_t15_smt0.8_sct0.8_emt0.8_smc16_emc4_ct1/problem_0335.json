Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nMr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class. In how many ways can he pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow? (The order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7 and 2 girls out of 4. Since the order of selection doesn't matter, we'll use combinations.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \n   The formula for combinations is:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\cdot 4!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \n   Similarly, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the two results to find the total number of ways to pick the group:**\n   \n   Since for each way of choosing the boys, there are 6 ways to choose the girls, multiply the two combinations.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) ="
