This is given by the formula (n-1)! for circular permutations, so (8-1)! = 7! = 5040.\n\nHowever, since the table is square, there are rotational symmetries that make some arrangements equivalent. A square has 4 sides, so there are 4 possible rotational positions that are considered the same. To account for this, I'll divide the total number of circular permutations by 4. \n\nDividing 5040 by 4 gives 1260 distinct arrangements. Therefore, there are 1260 different ways to seat the 8 people around the square table, considering rotational equivalence.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints:**\n   - The table is square, so rotations of the arrangement are considered equivalent.\n   - There are 2 people on each side of the table.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Arrangements Without Considering Rotations:**\n   - For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange `n` people is `(n-1)!` because rotations are considered the same.\n   - Here, `n = 8` (people), so total arrangements = `7! = 5040`.\n\n3. **Adjust for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - A square table has 4 sides, so there are 4 possible rotations that make arrangements equivalent.\n   - To account for this, divide the total arrangements by 4: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1260}\n\\]"
