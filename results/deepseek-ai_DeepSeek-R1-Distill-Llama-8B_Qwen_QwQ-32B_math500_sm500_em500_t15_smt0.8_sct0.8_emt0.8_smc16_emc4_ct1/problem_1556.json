            "output": "To determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we start by noting that the table has 4 sides.\n\nSince the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new configuration. This means that arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered identical.\n\nFirst, we fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix Person A at a specific seat. This leaves 7 remaining people to be seated.\n\nNext, we consider the arrangement around the table. Each side of the table will have 2 people. After fixing Person A, we need to determine how the remaining 7 people are distributed among the 4 sides.\n\nWe can think of this as arranging the remaining 7 people into the seats, with each side having exactly 2 seats. This is similar to distributing identical items into distinct groups with a specific number in each group.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute 7 people into 4 sides, with each side having 2 seats, is calculated by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2, 2, 2, 1} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2! \\times 1!} = 105\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the arrangement around the table is circular, we need to adjust for rotational symmetry. Fixing one person's position already accounts for this by eliminating the rotational duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 105.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a square table with **4 sides**.\n   - Each side will have exactly **2 people**.\n   - Rotations of the table are considered **equivalent** configurations.\n\n2. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - To eliminate rotational duplicates, fix one person in a specific seat. Let's fix **Person A** at a particular seat.\n\n3. **Distribute the Remaining People:**\n   - After fixing **Person A**, we have **7 people left** to seat.\n   - Since each side must have **2 people**, we need to distribute the remaining **7 people** into the **4 sides**.\n\n4. **"

            "output": "Use Multinomial Coefficient:**\n   - The problem reduces to arranging the remaining 7 people into 4 groups (sides) with 2, 2, 2, and 1 people respectively. However, since each side must have exactly 2 people, the last side must also have 2 people, but we only have 7 people left. This indicates an error in the initial approach.\n\n   **Correction:**  \n   Since there are **8 people total** and each side must have **2 people**, all 4 sides will have exactly 2 people each. Fixing one person's position leaves **7 people** to be arranged in the remaining **7 seats** (since one seat is already occupied by Person A). The remaining seats are distributed as follows:\n   - The side with Person A has **1 remaining seat**.\n   - The other 3 sides each have **2 seats**.\n\n   Thus, we need to distribute the remaining **7 people** into groups of **1, 2, 2, 2** for the four sides.\n\n5. **Calculate the Multinomial Coefficient:**\n   - The number of ways to partition 7 people into groups of 1, 2, 2, and 2 is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7!}{1! \\times 2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{5040}{1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2} = \\frac{5040}{8} = 630\n     \\]\n   - However, this counts the ways to partition the people, but we also need to consider the order of the groups (sides). Since the sides are distinguishable (they are fixed relative to the table after fixing Person A), we don't need to divide further.\n\n6. **Adjust for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - By fixing one person's position, we've already accounted for rotational symmetry. Thus, no further adjustments are needed.\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The total number of distinct seating arrangements is **630**.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the correction step. The correct approach is:\n\n- After fixing one person, the remaining 7 people must occupy the remaining 7 seats. The table has 4 sides, each with 2 seats. Fixing one person's"

However, this doesn't make sense because all sides should have 2 people. Therefore, the correct approach is:\n\n- Fix one person, leaving 7 people to be seated. Since there are 4 sides, each with 2 seats, but one seat is already occupied, we need to distribute the remaining 7 people into the remaining 7 seats.

The correct calculation is to consider the number of ways to assign 2 people to each side after fixing one person, which is \\(\\frac{7!}{(2!)^3}\\) divided by the number of sides, but this isn't the right approach. The correct way is to recognize that after fixing one person, we have 7 seats left, which can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways, but since the sides are fixed, the number of distinct arrangements is \\( \\frac{7!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} \\) divided by the number of rotational symmetries, but since we've fixed one person, it's just \\( \\frac{7!}{(2!)^3} = 630 \\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\boxed{630}"
