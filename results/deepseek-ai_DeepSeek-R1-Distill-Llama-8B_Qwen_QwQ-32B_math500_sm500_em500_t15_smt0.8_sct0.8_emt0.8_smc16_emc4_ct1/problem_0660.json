Let's denote the weight of one treek as T, one squig as S, and one goolee as G.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This translates to the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives me the equation:\n\n2T + G = S.\n\nTo find the relationship between treeks and squigs, I'll express S in terms of T and G using the second equation:\n\nS = 2T + G.\n\nNext, I'll substitute this expression for S into the first equation:\n\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n10T = 6T + 3G + G.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n\n4T = 4G.\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 4:\n\nT = G.\n\nSince one treek equals one goolee, I'll substitute T for G in the equation S = 2T + G:\n\nS = 2T + T.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nS = 3T.\n\nTherefore, three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n- \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n- \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Statements into Equations**\n1. **First Statement:**  \n   \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\"  \n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Second Statement:**  \n   \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\"  \n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Equation 2 into"
