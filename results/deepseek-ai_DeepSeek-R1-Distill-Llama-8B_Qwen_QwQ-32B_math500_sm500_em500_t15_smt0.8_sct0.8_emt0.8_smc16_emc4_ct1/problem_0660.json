            "output": "I need to determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig based on the given relationships.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to each item to make the problem easier to handle. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives the equation: 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal to one squig. This translates to: 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute S from the second equation into the first equation. Replacing S with (2T + G) in 10T = 3S + G, we get: 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation, it becomes: 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides gives: 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that T = G.\n\nSince T equals G, I can substitute back into the second equation: 2T + T = S, which simplifies to 3T = S.\n\nTherefore, three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks (T) weigh as much as three squigs (S) and one goolee (G):\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig:\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1.\n\n\\[\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 4G\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract \\(6T\\) from both sides.\n\n\\[\n"
