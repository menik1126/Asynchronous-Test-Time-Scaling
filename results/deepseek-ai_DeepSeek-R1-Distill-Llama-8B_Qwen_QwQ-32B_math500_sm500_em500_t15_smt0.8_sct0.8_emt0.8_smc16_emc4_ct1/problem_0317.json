Wait, this contradicts my initial thought. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the numerator is degree 1, denominator degree 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). But earlier I thought it was \\( y = 2 \\). That was a mistake.\n\nWait, let me correct this. The horizontal asymptote for a rational function where the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's is indeed \\( y = 0 \\). The leading coefficients ratio only applies when the degrees are equal. If the numerator's degree is exactly one less than the denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is still \\( y = 0 \\). \n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nThe horizontal asymptote rules:\n- If degree of numerator < degree of denominator: \\( y = 0 \\).\n- If degree of numerator = degree of denominator: \\( y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} \\).\n- If degree of numerator > degree of denominator: There is an oblique or curved asymptote.\n\nHere, numerator degree (1) < denominator degree (2), so horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, so my initial mistake was thinking the horizontal asymptote was 2, but actually it's 0. That changes the final answer.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The question says \"horizontal asymptote y = c\". So I need to recalculate.\n\nWait,"

The ratio is only for when the degrees are equal. When the degree of numerator is less than denominator, the horizontal asymptote is always \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nHence, in this case, \\( c = "

That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (2x)/x^2 = 2/x → y=0.\n\nThus, the horizontal asymptote is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, the initial mistake was in my first step when I thought it was 2. That was an error. Therefore, the correct answer is 5.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"horizontal asymptote y=c\". So c=0.
