            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes a and b, and the horizontal asymptote c, for the function f(x) = 2x / (x\u00b2 -5x -14). Then, I have to add them all together: a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find the values of x that make it zero.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try factoring that. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7, right? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). \n\nTherefore, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which means x = -2 and x = 7. So, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. That means a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. \n\nHere, the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is (x + 2)(x - 7), which is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator by 1, the horizontal asymptote should be the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (from x\u00b2). So, the horizontal asymptote y = c is 2/1 = 2. Therefore, c = 2.\n\nNow, the problem asks for a + b + c. Substituting the values I found: a = -2, b = 7, c = 2. So, adding them together: (-2) + 7 + 2. Let's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, (-2) + 7. That's 5. Then"

            "output": " 5 + 2 is 7. Wait, so the total is 7? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to be sure.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes: denominator factors to (x + 2)(x -7), so roots at x = -2 and 7. That's correct. So a and b are indeed -2 and 7. Adding them gives -2 +7 =5. Then horizontal asymptote: since the denominator's degree is higher, the horizontal asymptote is y=0? Wait a second, hold on! Did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh no, I think I messed up the horizontal asymptote part. Let me recall the rules again. \n\nThe horizontal asymptote for a rational function:\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.\n\n- If the degrees are equal, it's the ratio of leading coefficients.\n\n- If the numerator's degree is exactly one more than the denominator's, there's an oblique asymptote.\n\nIn this case, numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. So numerator degree is less than denominator. Therefore, horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So c should be 0, not 2. Oh no! I made a mistake earlier. \n\nSo that changes things. So c is 0. Therefore, a + b + c would be (-2) +7 +0 =5. Wait, so that's different. So I need to correct that.\n\nWait, why did I think it was 2 before? Because I thought the leading coefficients ratio, but that's only when the degrees are equal. Since the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is zero. So that was my mistake. \n\nLet me confirm with an example. Suppose f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2). Then as x approaches infinity, that's 2/x, which approaches 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote at y=0. Similarly, in this case, the denominator is quadratic, numerator linear, so same idea. So c is 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct sum is a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 =5. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think of another example. Suppose f(x)=3x/(x^2 -1). Then horizontal asymptote is y=0."

            "output": " So same logic. So in my problem, same thing applies because numerator degree is less than denominator. So yeah, c is 0.\n\nWait a second, but perhaps I should verify using limits. The horizontal asymptote is the limit as x approaches infinity of f(x). So let me compute that.\n\nCompute limit as x approaches infinity of (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). Divide numerator and denominator by x\u00b2:\n\n(2/x)/(1 -5/x -14/x\u00b2). As x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0, -5/x approaches 0, and -14/x\u00b2 approaches 0. So the entire expression approaches 0/1 =0. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y=0, so c=0.\n\nSo that was a crucial mistake in my earlier reasoning. So the sum is 5, not 7. So, a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 =5.\n\nWait, let me confirm the vertical asymptotes again. To make sure I didn't factor the denominator incorrectly.\n\nx\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me compute discriminant: b\u00b2 -4ac=25 +56=81. Square root of 81 is 9. So roots are [5 \u00b19]/2. So (5+9)/2=14/2=7, and (5-9)/2= (-4)/2= -2. So, correct, x=7 and x=-2. So vertical asymptotes at x=-2 and x=7. So a=-2, b=7.\n\nSo the correct sum is (-2) +7 +0=5. So the final answer is 5.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me think step by step again.\n\n1. Factor denominator: x\u00b2 -5x -14.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Those are -7 and 2. So factors are (x + 2)(x -7). Correct.\n\n2. Vertical Asymptotes at roots of denominator, excluding zeros of numerator. Numerator is 2x, so at x=0. But denominator is zero at x=-2 and 7. So vertical asymptotes at x=-2 and 7. So a=-2, b=7.\n\n3.

Therefore, I should put 5 in the box.\n\nWait, but just to confirm once more with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the horizontal asymptote is found by dividing leading coefficients. Wait, the leading term of numerator is 2x, denominator is x\u00b2. So if I write the function as (2x)/(x\u00b2) when x is very large, which is 2/x, which goes to zero. So yes, the horizontal asymptote is still 0.\n\nYes, so all steps check.
