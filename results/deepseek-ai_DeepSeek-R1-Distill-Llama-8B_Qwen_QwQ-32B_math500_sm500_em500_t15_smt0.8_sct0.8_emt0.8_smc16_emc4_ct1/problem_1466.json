            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hot-air balloon and some ropes. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. There's point O, and points A, B, C, D are all positioned directly north, west, south, and east of O respectively. So, A is north of O, B is west, C is south, and D is east. The balloon H is directly above O at some height. There are four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. HC is 150 meters, HD is 130 meters. Now, they want to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere along the straight line connecting C and D. The goal is to figure out the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this.\n\nOkay, so to rephrase, instead of having two separate ropes from H to C and from H to D, we can have one rope from H to a point P on CD. The total length saved would be the difference between the sum of HC and HD and the length of HP. We need to maximize the saved length, which means minimizing the length of HP.\n\nWait, actually, no, not necessarily minimizing HP, but since the sum of HC and HD is fixed (150 + 130 = 280 meters), the saved length would be 280 minus the length of HP. Therefore, to maximize the saved length, we need to minimize the length of HP. So, the problem reduces to finding the shortest possible HP where P is on the line segment CD.\n\nHmm, but CD is a straight line on the ground. So, point P has to lie somewhere between C and D. Since H is above O, HP is a straight line from H to P. So, we're looking for the shortest possible distance from H to the line segment CD. The minimal HP would be the shortest distance from H to CD, right? Because if the rope can just touch the line CD at the closest point, that would be the minimal HP.\n\nWait, but P has to be on the straight line CD. So, the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to CD. But hold on, is CD straight? Yes, because C is directly south of O and D is east of O, so CD is a diagonal line from south to east relative to O. So, CD is a straight line, but not"

Let's let point O be at the origin (0, 0). Since A is north of O, let's assume the direction north is positive y-axis, east is positive x-axis. So, coordinates:\n\n- O is (0,0)\n- A is directly north, so (0, a) for some a.\n- B is directly west, so (-b, 0) for some b.\n- C is directly south, so (0, -c) for some c.\n- D is directly east, so (d, 0) for some d.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the distance between C and D is 140 m. So, the straight-line distance between C (0, -c) and D (d, 0) is 140. So, sqrt[(d)^2 + (c)^2] = 140. That's an equation we might need later.\n\nNow, the balloon H is directly above O, so its coordinates would be (0,0,h), where h is the height. So H is (0,0,h).\n\nNow, the ropes HC and HD have lengths 150 and 130 respectively. Let's write equations for those.\n\nThe rope HC goes from H (0,0,h) to C (0, -c). The distance HC is sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2] = sqrt[c^2 + h^2] = 150.\n\nSimilarly, HD is from H (0,0,h) to D (d,0,0). Wait, no, D is on the ground, so D is (d,0,0)? Wait, actually, all the points A, B, C, D, O are on the ground, so their z-coordinate is 0, and H is at (0,0,h). So coordinates:\n\n- H: (0, 0, h)\n- C: (0, -c, 0)\n- D: (d, 0, 0)\n\nThus, the distance HC is sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2] ="

The minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD.\n\nWait, but since CD is in 3D space, but P must lie on CD, so it's the minimal distance from H to CD, which is the length of the perpendicular from H to CD.\n\nWait, let me think. So, in 3D, the minimal distance from a point to a line is calculated using the formula:\n\nDistance = |(P - Q) × v| / |v|,\n\nwhere P is the point, Q is a point on the line, and v is the direction vector of the line.\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize the line CD and find the point P on CD that is closest to H.\n\nSo, let me parametrize CD.\n\nParametrize CD as follows: Starting at C (0, -80√2, 0) and moving towards D (20√17, 0, 0).
