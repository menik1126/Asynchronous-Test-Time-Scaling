The question mentions a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. This plane cuts the tetrahedron into two pieces, and I need to find the surface area of one of these pieces.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron looks like. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 2 in this case.\n\nNow, the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD. That means the plane won't intersect these edges but will pass somewhere in between them. Since it's lying halfway between AB and CD, I need to figure out where exactly that midpoint is along the line connecting these two edges.\n\nWait, edges AB and CD are skew lines in the tetrahedron because they don't lie in the same plane and don't intersect. So, how do I find the halfway point between them? Maybe I need to consider the line segment connecting the midpoints of AB and CD?\n\nLet me visualize the tetrahedron. Points A, B, C, D are all connected such that each pair is connected by an edge of length 2. If I look at edges AB and CD, they are opposite each other in the tetrahedron. So, the line connecting their midpoints would be a line that's in the middle of the tetrahedron.\n\nI think the halfway point is along the segment connecting the midpoints of AB and CD. So, I should find the coordinates of these midpoints to find the plane's position.\n\nMaybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron would help. Let me place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make the problem more concrete.\n\nLet's position vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since it's a regular tetrahedron, the other vertices can be placed in a way that all edges are equal. The coordinates of a regular tetrahedron can be set as follows:\n\nA: (0, 0, 0)\nB: (2, 0, 0)\nC: (1, √3, 0)\nD: (1, √3/3, √6/3)\n\nI recall that the height (from a vertex to the opposite face) of"

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I got the coordinates wrong.\n\nOh right, maybe these coordinates are for a tetrahedron with edge length sqrt(2)? Wait, perhaps I need a different coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better way is to construct coordinates for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2. Let me recall the standard coordinates for a regular tetrahedron:\n\nOne standard way is to select coordinates where one vertex is at (1,1,1), and others are permutations, but scaled appropriately. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to set one vertex at the origin.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method for coordinates of a regular tetrahedron:\n\nLet me look up the standard coordinates. Alternatively, maybe set vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (2,0,0), vertex C at (1, √3,0), and vertex D at (1, √3/3, h), where h is the height from D to the base ABC.\n\nThe height h can be calculated using the edge length.

Edge CD is from C (1, √3, 0) to D (1, √3/3, 2√6/3).\n\nSince the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it's parallel to both edges. So, the plane's direction is determined by the direction vectors of AB and CD.\n\nWait, but the plane is said to be parallel to both AB and CD. So, the plane's normal vector would be perpendicular to both direction vectors of AB and CD.\n\nSo, first, let's find the direction vectors.\n\nAB vector is B - A = (2, 0, 0). So direction vector is (2,0,0), or (1,0,0) when simplified.\n\nCD vector is D - C = (1 -1, √3/3 - √3, 2√6/3 - 0) = (0, (-2√3)/3, 2√6/3). Thus, CD direction vector is (0, -2√3/3, 2√6/3).

Since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, the plane's normal vector must be perpendicular to both AB and CD.\n\nAlternatively, the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, meaning that it contains lines that are parallel to both AB and CD. So, the plane can be thought of as being generated by translating a line segment parallel to AB and another parallel to CD, and connecting them.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to find a plane that is parallel to both AB and CD. So, the plane will have a normal vector that is the cross product of AB and CD's direction vectors.\n\nLet me compute the normal vector of the plane.\n\nThe direction vector of AB is (2,0,0).

This is the normal vector of the plane.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as (0, -4√6/3, -4√3/3). To make it simpler, we can factor out -4/3, so the normal vector is proportional to (0, √6, √3). But the direction is important for the plane equation.\n\nNow, the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, so it must be offset from them. Since it's halfway between them, we need to find the equation of the plane such that it is equidistant from AB and CD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plane is located at the midpoint between AB and CD.

The plane cuts edges AC and BC at P1(1/2, √3/2,0) and P2(3/2, √3/2,0). The line P1P2 is horizontal at y=√3/2, from x=1/2 to x=3/2.\n\nTherefore, the portion of ABC on the A-B side is the region below this line. Since the original triangle ABC has its apex at C (1,√3,0). The line P1P2 is halfway up the triangle in the y-direction.\n\nThe area of the portion on the A-B"

Wait, AC has length 2, because from (0,0,0) to (1,√3,0), the distance is 2.\n\nWait, wait, AC is from A(0,0,0) to C(1, √3,0). So AC's midpoint is at (0.5, √3/2,0), which is exactly P1. Similarly, BC is from B(2,0,0) to C(1,√3,0). The midpoint is at ( (2+1)/2, (0 + √3)/2, 0 )=(1.5, √3/2,0), which is P2.\n\nTherefore, P1 and P2 are the midpoints of AC and BC.\n\nTherefore, the line P1P2 is the midline of triangle ABC, so the area of the portion on the A-B side is a smaller triangle with base P1P2 and height from AB.\n\nSince P1P2 is at the midline, the area is 1/4 of the original triangle ABC.\n\nWait, since the midline divides the triangle into four smaller triangles, each similar with 1/4 area.\n\nWait, but ABC has area √3, so the area on the A-B side is √3/4.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nArea of face ABC is √3.\n\nThe midline P1P2 divides ABC into a smaller triangle above it and a quadrilateral below it. Wait, but since P1 and P2 are midpoints, the area above P1P2 (the small triangle) has area 1/4 of ABC, and the area below is 3/4.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if you draw a midline in a triangle, the area above the midline is 1/4 of the original triangle. So the area above is 1/4, so the area below is 3/4.\n\nBut wait, P1P2 is the midline. So the part of ABC on the side of A-B is the region below P1P2, which is a trapezoid."

The height of the trapezoid is the distance from AB to the line P1P2.\n\nThe height of the original triangle ABC is √3 (since it's an equilateral triangle with side 2, height is (√3/2)*2=√3). The midline is halfway up, so the height from AB to P1P2 is half the total height, so √3/2.\n\nWait, but the height of the trapezoid would be the distance from AB to the line P1P2. Since the original height is √3, and the midline is halfway, the distance from AB to P1P2 is √3/2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is ( (base1 + base2)/2 ) * height.\n\nBase1 is AB: length 2.\n\nBase2 is P1P2: length 1 (since from x=0.5 to 1.5 is 1 unit).\n\nHeight is √3/2.\n\nThus, area = (2 +1)/2 * (√3/2)= (3/2)*(√3/2)= 3√3/4.\n\nWhich is 3/4 of the original area (since original area is √3). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area of the portion of ABC on the A-B side is 3√3/4.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the areas of the other original faces on the A-B side.\n\n"
